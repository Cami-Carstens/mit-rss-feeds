  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rohit Karnik, the Tata Professor in the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering, has been named the new director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS), effective March 1. Karnik, who has served as associate director of J-WAFS since 2023, succeeds founding director John H. Lienhard V, Abdul Latif Jameel Professor of Water and Mechanical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnik assumes the role of director at a pivotal time for J-WAFS, as it celebrates its 10th anniversary. Announcing the appointment today in a letter to the J-WAFS research community, Vice President for Research Ian A. Waitz noted Karnik’s deep involvement with the lab’s research efforts and programming, as well as his accolades as a researcher, teacher, leader, and mentor. “I am delighted that Rohit will bring his talent and vision to bear on the J-WAFS mission, ensuring the program sustains its direct support of research on campus and its important impact around the world,” Waitz wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS is the only program at MIT focused exclusively on water and food research. Since 2015, the lab has made grants totaling approximately $25M to researchers across the Institute, including from all five schools and 40 departments, labs, and centers. It has supported 300 faculty, research staff, and students combined. Furthermore, the J-WAFS Solutions Program, which supports efforts to commercialize innovative water and food technologies, has spun out 12 companies and two open-sourced products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We launched J-WAFS with the aim of building a community of water and food researchers at MIT, taking advantage of MIT’s strengths in so many disciplines that contribute to these most essential human needs,” writes Lienhard, who will retire this June. “After a decade’s work, that community is strong and visible. I am delighted that Rohit has agreed to take the reins. He will bring the program to the next level.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lienhard has served as director since founding J-WAFS in 2014, along with executive director Renee J. Robins ’83, who last fall shared her intent to retire as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big change for a program to turn over both the director and executive director roles at the same time,” says Robins. “Having worked alongside Rohit as our associate director for the past couple of years, I am greatly assured that J-WAFS will be in good hands with a new and steady leadership team.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnik became associate director of J-WAFS in July 2023, a move that coincided with the start of a sabbatical for Lienhard. Before that time, Karnik was already well engaged with J-WAFS as a grant recipient, reviewer, and community member. As associate director, Rohit has been integral to J-WAFS operations, planning, and grant management, including the proposal selection process. He was instrumental in planning the second J-WAFS Grand Challenge grant and led workshops at which researchers brainstormed proposal topics and formed teams. Karnik also engaged with J-WAFS’ corporate partners, helped plan lectures and events, and offered project oversight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The experience gave me broad exposure to the amazing ideas and research at MIT in the water and food space, and the collaborations and synergies across departments and schools that enable excellence in research,” says Karnik. “The strengths of J-WAFS lie in being able to support principal investigators in pursuing research to address humanity’s water and food needs; in creating a community of students though the fellowship program and support of student clubs; and in bringing people together at seminars, workshops, and other events. All of this is made possible by the endowment and a dedicated team with close involvement in the projects after the grants are awarded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS was established through a generous gift from &lt;a href="https://www.communityjameel.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Community Jameel&lt;/a&gt;, an independent, global organization advancing science to help communities thrive in a rapidly changing world. The lab was named in honor of the late Abdul Latif Jameel, the founder of the Abdul Latif Jameel company and father of MIT alumnus Mohammed Jameel ’78, who founded and chairs Community Jameel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS’ operations are carried out by a small but passionate team of people at MIT who are dedicated to the mission of securing water and food systems. That mission is more important than ever, as climate change, urbanization, and a growing global population are putting tremendous stress on the world’s water and food supplies. These challenges drive J-WAFS’ efforts to mobilize the research, innovation, and technology that can sustainably secure humankind’s most vital resources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As director, Karnik will help shape the research agenda and key priorities for J-WAFS and usher the program into its second decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnik originally joined MIT as a postdoc in the departments of Mechanical and Chemical Engineering in October 2006. In September 2007, he became an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, before being promoted to associate professor in 2012. His research group focuses on the physics of micro- and nanofluidic flows and applying that to the design of micro- and nanofluidic systems for applications in water, healthcare, energy, and the environment. Past projects include ones on membranes for water filtration and chemical separations, sensors for water, and water filters from waste wood. Karnik has served as associate department head and interim co-department head in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. He also serves as faculty director of the New Engineering Education Transformation (NEET) program in the School of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before coming to MIT, Karnik received a bachelor’s degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay, and a master’s and PhD from the University of California at Berkeley, all in mechanical engineering. He has authored numerous publications, is co-inventor on several patents, and has received awards and honors including the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the U.S. Department of Energy Early Career Award, the MIT Office of Graduate Education’s Committed to Caring award, and election to the National Academy of Inventors as a senior member.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lienhard, J-WAFS’ outgoing director, has served on the MIT faculty since 1988. His research and educational efforts have focused on heat and mass transfer, water purification and desalination, thermodynamics, and separation processes. Lienhard has directly supervised more than 90 PhD and master’s theses, and he is the author of over 300 peer-reviewed papers and three textbooks. He holds more than 40 U.S. patents, most commercialized through startup companies with his students. One of these, the water treatment company Gradiant Corporation, is now valued over $1 billion and employs more than 1,200 people. Lienhard has received many awards, including the 2024 Lifetime Achievement Award of the International Desalination and Reuse Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1998, Renee Robins has worked on the conception, launch, and development of a number of large interdisciplinary, international, and partnership-based research and education collaborations at MIT and elsewhere. She served in roles for the Cambridge MIT Institute, the MIT Portugal Program, the Mexico City Program, the Program on Emerging Technologies, and the Technology and Policy Program. She holds two undergraduate degrees from MIT, in biology and humanities/anthropology, and a master’s degree in public policy from Carnegie Mellon University. She has overseen significant growth in J-WAFS’ activities, funding, staffing, and collaborations over the past decade. In 2021, she was awarded an Infinite Mile Award in the area of the Offices of the Provost and Vice President for Research, in recognition of her contributions within her role at J-WAFS to help the Institute carry out its mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“John and Renee have done a remarkable job in establishing J-WAFS and bringing it up to its present form,” says Karnik. “I’m committed to making sure that the key aspects of J-WAFS that bring so much value to the MIT community, the nation, and the world continue to function well. MIT researchers and alumni in the J-WAFS community are already having an impact on addressing humanity’s water and food needs, and I believe that there is potential for MIT to have an even greater positive impact on securing humanity’s vital resources in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) has transformed the landscape of water and food research at MIT, driving faculty engagement and catalyzing new research and innovation in these critical areas. With philanthropic, corporate, and government support, J-WAFS’ strategic approach spans the entire research life cycle, from support for early-stage research to commercialization grants for more advanced projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, J-WAFS has invested approximately $25 million in direct research funding to support MIT faculty pursuing transformative research with the potential for significant impact. “Since awarding our first cohort of seed grants in 2015, it’s remarkable to look back and see that over 10 percent of the MIT faculty have benefited from J-WAFS funding,” observes J-WAFS Executive Director Renee J. Robins ’83. “Many of these professors hadn’t worked on water or food challenges before their first J-WAFS grant.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and supporting high-risk, high-reward projects, J-WAFS has amplified the capacity of MIT faculty to pursue groundbreaking research that addresses some of the world’s most pressing challenges facing our water and food systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawing MIT faculty to water and food research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS open calls for proposals enable faculty to explore bold ideas and develop impactful approaches to tackling critical water and food system challenges. Professor Patrick Doyle’s work in water purification exemplifies this impact. “Without J-WAFS, I would have never ventured into the field of water purification,” Doyle reflects. While previously focused on pharmaceutical manufacturing and drug delivery, exposure to J-WAFS-funded peers led him to apply his expertise in soft materials to water purification. “Both the funding and the J-WAFS community led me to be deeply engaged in understanding some of the key challenges in water purification and water security,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Professor Otto Cordero of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) leveraged J-WAFS funding to pivot his research into aquaculture. Cordero explains that his first J-WAFS seed grant “has been extremely influential for my lab because it allowed me to take a step in a new direction, with no preliminary data in hand.” Cordero’s expertise is in microbial communities. He was previous unfamiliar with aquaculture, but he saw the relevance of microbial communities the health of farmed aquatic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting early-career faculty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New assistant professors at MIT have particularly benefited from J-WAFS funding and support. J-WAFS has played a transformative role in shaping the careers and research trajectories of many new faculty members by encouraging them to explore novel research areas, and in many instances providing their first MIT research grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Ariel Furst reflects on how pivotal J-WAFS’ investment has been in advancing her research. “This was one of the first grants I received after starting at MIT, and it has truly shaped the development of my group’s research program,” Furst explains. With J-WAFS’ backing, her lab has achieved breakthroughs in chemical detection and remediation technologies for water. “The support of J-WAFS has enabled us to develop the platform funded through this work beyond the initial applications to the general detection of environmental contaminants and degradation of those contaminants,” she elaborates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karthish Manthiram, now a professor of chemical engineering and chemistry at Caltech, explains how J-WAFS’ early investment enabled him and other young faculty to pursue ambitious ideas. “J-WAFS took a big risk on us,” Manthiram reflects. His research on breaking the nitrogen triple bond to make ammonia for fertilizer was initially met with skepticism. However, J-WAFS’ seed funding allowed his lab to lay the groundwork for breakthroughs that later attracted significant National Science Foundation (NSF) support. “That early funding from J-WAFS has been pivotal to our long-term success,” he notes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stories underscore the broad impact of J-WAFS’ support for early-career faculty, and its commitment to empowering them to address critical global challenges and innovate boldly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fueling follow-on funding&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS seed grants enable faculty to explore nascent research areas, but external funding for continued work is usually necessary to achieve the full potential of these novel ideas. “It’s often hard to get funding for early stage or out-of-the-box ideas,” notes J-WAFS Director Professor John H. Lienhard V. “My hope, when I founded J-WAFS in 2014, was that seed grants would allow PIs [principal investigators] to prove out novel ideas so that they would be attractive for follow-on funding. And after 10 years, J-WAFS-funded research projects have brought more than $21 million in subsequent awards to MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Retsef Levi led a seed study on how agricultural supply chains affect food safety, with a team of faculty spanning the MIT schools&amp;nbsp;Engineering and Science as well as the MIT Sloan School of Management. The team parlayed their seed grant research into a multi-million-dollar follow-on initiative. Levi reflects, “The J-WAFS seed funding allowed us to establish the initial credibility of our team, which was key to our success in obtaining large funding from several other agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Des Marais was an assistant professor in the Department of CEE when he received his first J-WAFS seed grant. The funding supported his research on how plant growth and physiology are controlled by genes and interact with the environment. The seed grant helped launch his lab’s work addressing enhancing climate change resilience in agricultural systems. The work led to his Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the NSF, a prestigious honor for junior faculty members. Now an associate professor, Des Marais’ ongoing project to further investigate the mechanisms and consequences of genomic and environmental interactions is supported by the five-year, $1,490,000 NSF grant. “J-WAFS providing essential funding to get my new research underway,” comments Des Marais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating interdisciplinary collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des Marais’ seed grant was also key to developing new collaborations. He explains, “the J-WAFS grant supported me to develop a collaboration with Professor Caroline Uhler in EECS/IDSS [the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science/Institute for Data, Systems, and Society] that really shaped how I think about framing and testing hypotheses. One of the best things about J-WAFS is facilitating unexpected connections among MIT faculty with diverse yet complementary skill sets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professors A. John Hart of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Benedetto Marelli of CEE also launched a new interdisciplinary collaboration with J-WAFS funding. They partnered to join expertise in biomaterials, microfabrication, and manufacturing, to create printed silk-based colorimetric sensors that detect food spoilage. “The J-WAFS Seed Grant provided a unique opportunity for multidisciplinary collaboration,” Hart notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professors Stephen Graves in the MIT Sloan School of Management and Bishwapriya Sanyal in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) partnered to pursue new research on agricultural supply chains. With field work in Senegal, their J-WAFS-supported project brought together international development specialists and operations management experts to study how small firms and government agencies influence access to and uptake of irrigation technology by poorer farmers. “We used J-WAFS to spur a collaboration that would have been improbable without this grant,” they explain. Being part of the J-WAFS community also introduced them to researchers in Professor Amos Winter’s lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering working on irrigation technologies for low-resource settings. DUSP doctoral candidate Mark Brennan notes, “We got to share our understanding of how irrigation markets and irrigation supply chains work in developing economies, and then we got to contrast that with their understanding of how irrigation system models work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy Swager, professor of chemistry, and Rohit Karnik, professor of mechanical engineering and J-WAFS associate director, collaborated on a sponsored research project supported by Xylem, Inc. through the J-WAFS Research Affiliate program. The cross-disciplinary research, which targeted the development of ultra-sensitive sensors for toxic PFAS chemicals, was conceived following a series of workshops hosted by J-WAFS. Swager and Karnik were two of the participants, and their involvement led to the collaborative proposal that Xylem funded. “J-WAFS funding allowed us to combine Swager lab’s expertise in sensing with my lab’s expertise in microfluidics to develop a cartridge for field-portable detection of PFAS,” says Karnik. “J-WAFS has enriched my research program in so many ways,” adds Swager, who is now working to commercialize the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving global collaboration and impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS has also helped MIT faculty establish and advance international collaboration and impactful global research. By funding and supporting projects that connect MIT researchers with international partners, J-WAFS has not only advanced technological solutions, but also strengthened cross-cultural understanding and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Matthew Shoulders leads the inaugural J-WAFS Grand Challenge project. In response to the first J-WAFS call for “Grand Challenge” proposals, Shoulders assembled an interdisciplinary team based at MIT to enhance and provide climate resilience to agriculture by improving the most inefficient aspect of photosynthesis, the notoriously-inefficient carbon dioxide-fixing plant enzyme RuBisCO. J-WAFS funded this high-risk/high-reward project following a competitive process that engaged external reviewers through a several rounds of iterative proposal development. The technical feedback to the team led them to researchers with complementary expertise&amp;nbsp;from the Australian National University. “Our collaborative team of biochemists and synthetic biologists, computational biologists, and chemists is deeply integrated with plant biologists and field trial experts, yielding a robust feedback loop for enzyme engineering,” Shoulders says. “Together, this team will be able to make a concerted effort using the most modern, state-of-the-art techniques to engineer crop RuBisCO with an eye to helping make meaningful gains in securing a stable crop supply, hopefully with accompanying improvements in both food and water security.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Leon Glicksman and Research Engineer Eric Verploegen’s team designed a low-cost cooling chamber to preserve fruits and vegetables harvested by smallholder farmers with no access to cold chain storage. J-WAFS’ guidance motivated the team to prioritize practical considerations informed by local collaborators, ensuring market competitiveness. “As our new idea for a forced-air evaporative cooling chamber was taking shape, we continually checked that our solution was evolving in a direction that would be competitive in terms of cost, performance, and usability to existing commercial alternatives,” explains Verploegen, who is currently an MIT D-Lab affiliate. Following the team’s initial seed grant, the team secured a J-WAFS Solutions commercialization grant, which Verploegen say “further motivated us to establish partnerships with local organizations capable of commercializing the technology earlier in the project than we might have done otherwise.” The team has since shared an open-source design as part of its commercialization strategy to maximize accessibility and impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing corporate sponsored research opportunities to MIT faculty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS also plays a role in driving private partnerships, enabling collaborations that bridge industry and academia. Through its Research Affiliate Program, for example, J-WAFS provides opportunities for faculty to collaborate with industry on sponsored research, helping to convert scientific discoveries into licensable intellectual property (IP) that companies can turn into commercial products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS introduced professor of mechanical engineering Alex Slocum to a challenge presented by its research affiliate company, Xylem: how to design a more energy-efficient pump for fluctuating flows. With centrifugal pumps consuming an estimated 6 percent of U.S. electricity annually, Slocum and his then-graduate student Hilary Johnson SM '18, PhD '22 developed an innovative variable volute mechanism that reduces energy usage. “Xylem envisions this as the first in a new category of adaptive pump geometry,” comments Johnson. The research produced a pump prototype and related IP that Xylem is working on commercializing. Johnson notes that these outcomes “would not have been possible without J-WAFS support and facilitation of the Xylem industry partnership.” Slocum adds, “J-WAFS enabled Hilary to begin her work on pumps, and Xylem sponsored the research to bring her to this point … where she has an opportunity to do far more than the original project called for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swager speaks highly of the impact of corporate research sponsorship through J-WAFS on his research and technology translation efforts. His PFAS project with Karnik described above was also supported by Xylem. “Xylem was an excellent sponsor of our research. Their engagement and feedback were instrumental in advancing our PFAS detection technology, now on the path to commercialization,” Swager says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What J-WAFS has accomplished is more than a collection of research projects; a decade of impact demonstrates how J-WAFS’ approach has been transformative for many MIT faculty members. As Professor Mathias Kolle puts it, his engagement with J-WAFS “had a significant influence on how we think about our research and its broader impacts.” He adds that it “opened my eyes to the challenges in the field of water and food systems and the many different creative ideas that are explored by MIT.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thriving ecosystem of innovation, collaboration, and academic growth around water and food research has not only helped faculty build interdisciplinary and international partnerships, but has also led to the commercialization of transformative technologies with real-world applications. C. Cem Taşan, the POSCO Associate Professor of Metallurgy who is leading a J-WAFS Solutions commercialization team that is about to launch a startup company, sums it up by noting, “Without J-WAFS, we wouldn’t be here at all.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS looks to the future, its continued commitment — supported by the generosity of its donors and partners — builds on a decade of success enabling MIT faculty to advance water and food research that addresses some of the world’s most pressing challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Haber-Bosch process, which converts atmospheric nitrogen to make ammonia fertilizer, revolutionized agriculture and helped feed the world’s growing population, but it also created huge environmental problems. It is one of the most energy-intensive chemical processes in the world, responsible for 1-2 percent of global energy consumption. It also releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that harms the ozone layer. Excess nitrogen also routinely runs off farms into waterways, harming marine life and polluting groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In place of synthetic fertilizer, Pivot Bio has engineered nitrogen-producing microbes to make farming more sustainable. The company, which was co-founded by Professor Chris Voigt, Karsten Temme, and Alvin Tamsir, has engineered its microbes to grow on plant roots, where they feed on the root’s sugars and precisely deliver nitrogen in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s microbial colonies grow with the plant and produce more nitrogen at exactly the time the plant needs it, minimizing nitrogen runoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way we have delivered nutrients to support plant growth historically is fertilizer, but that’s an inefficient way to get all the nutrients you need,” says Temme, Pivot’s chief innovation officer. “We have the ability now to help farmers be more efficient and productive with microbes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers can replace up to 40 pounds per acre of traditional nitrogen with Pivot’s product, which amounts to about a quarter of the total nitrogen needed for a crop like corn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s products are already being used to grow corn, wheat, barley, oats, and other grains across millions of acres of American farmland, eliminating hundreds of thousands of tons of CO2 equivalent in the process. The company’s impact is even more striking given its unlikely origins, which trace back to one of the most challenging times of Voigt’s career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Pivot from despair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beginning of every faculty member’s career can be a sink-or-swim moment, and by Voigt’s own account, he was drowning. As a freshly minted assistant professor at the University of California at San Francisco, Voigt was struggling to stand up his lab, attract funding, and get experiments started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 2008, Voigt joined a research group out of the University of California at Berkeley that was writing a grant proposal focused on photovoltaic materials. His initial role was minor, but a senior researcher pulled out of the group a week before the proposal had to be submitted, so Voigt stepped up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said ‘I’ll finish this section in a week,’” Voigt recalls. “It was my big chance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the proposal, Voigt detailed an ambitious plan to rearrange the genetics of biologic photosynthetic systems to make them more efficient. He barely submitted it in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months went by, then the proposal reviews finally came back. Voigt hurried to the meeting with some of the most senior researchers at UC Berkeley to discuss the responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My part of the proposal got completely slammed,” Voigt says. “There were something like 15 reviews on it — they were longer than the actual grant — and it’s just one after another tearing into my proposal. All the most famous people are in this meeting, future energy secretaries, future leaders of the university, and it was totally embarrassing. After that meeting, I was considering leaving academia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few discouraging months later, Voigt got a call from Paul Ludden, the dean of the School of Science at UC Berkeley. He wanted to talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I walk into Paul’s office, he’s reading my proposal,” Voigt recalls. “He sits me down and says, ‘Everybody’s telling me how terrible this is.’ I’m thinking, ‘Oh my God.’ But then he says, ‘I think there’s something here. Your idea is good, you just picked the wrong system.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludden went on to explain to Voigt that he should apply his gene-swapping idea to nitrogen fixation. He even offered to send Voigt a postdoc from his lab, Dehua Zhao, to help. Voigt paired Zhao with Temme, and sure enough, the resulting 2011 paper of their work was well-received by the nitrogen fixation community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nitrogen fixation has been a holy grail for scientists, agronomists, and farmers for almost a century, ever since somebody discovered the first microbe that can fix nitrogen for legumes like soybeans,” Temme says. “Everybody always said that someday we'll be able to do this for the cereal crops. The excitement with Pivot was this is the first time that technology became accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voigt had moved to MIT in 2010. When the paper came out, he founded Pivot Bio with Temme and another Berkeley researcher, Alvin Tamsir. Since then, Voigt, who is the Daniel I.C. Wang Professor at MIT and the head of the Department of Biological Engineering, has continued collaborating with Pivot on things like increasing nitrogen production, making strains more stable, and making them inducible to different signals from the plant. Pivot has licensed technology from MIT, and the research has also received support from MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s first goals were to gain regulatory approval and prove themselves in the marketplace. To gain approval in the U.S., Pivot’s team focused on using DNA from within the same organism rather than bringing in totally new DNA, which simplified the approval process. It also partnered with independent corn seed dealers to get its product to farms. Early deployments occurred in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers apply Pivot’s product at planting, either as a liquid that gets sprayed on the soil or as a dry powder that is rehydrated and applied to the seeds as a coating. The microbes live on the surface of the growing root system, eating plant sugars and releasing nitrogen throughout the plant’s life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today, our microbes colonize just a fraction of the total sugars provided by the plant,” Temme explains. “They’re also sharing ammonia with the plant, and all of those things are just a portion of what’s possible technically. Our team is always trying to figure out how to make those microbes more efficient at getting the energy they need to grow or at fixing nitrogen and sharing it with the crop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Pivot started the N-Ovator program to connect companies with growers who practice sustainable farming using Pivot’s microbial nitrogen. Through the program, companies buy nitrogen credits and farmers can get paid by verifying their practices. The program was named one of the Inventions of the Year by &lt;em&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/em&gt; last year and has paid out millions of dollars to farmers to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial nitrogen and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot is currently selling to farmers across the U.S. and working with smallholder farmers in Kenya. It’s also hoping to gain approval for its microbial solution in Brazil and Canada, which it hopes will be its next markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do we get the economics to make sense for everybody — the farmers, our partners, and the company?” Temme says of Pivot’s mission. “Because this truly can be a deflationary technology that upends the very expensive traditional way of making fertilizer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivot’s team is also extending the product to cotton, and Temme says microbes can be a nitrogen source for any type of plant on the planet. Further down the line, the company believes it can help farmers with other nutrients essential to help their crops grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we’ve established our technology, how can Pivot help farmers overcome all the other limitations they face with crop nutrients to maximize yields?” Temme asks. “That really starts to change the way a farmer thinks about managing the entire acre from a price, productivity, and sustainability perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sara Beery came to MIT as an assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) eager to focus on ecological challenges. She has fashioned her research career around the opportunity to apply her expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and data science to tackle real-world issues in conservation and sustainability. Beery was drawn to the Institute’s commitment to “computing for the planet,” and set out to bring her methods to global-scale environmental and biodiversity monitoring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Pacific Northwest, salmon have a disproportionate impact on the health of their ecosystems, and their complex reproductive needs have attracted Beery’s attention. Each year, millions of salmon embark on a migration to spawn. Their journey begins in freshwater stream beds where the eggs hatch. Young salmon fry (newly hatched salmon) make their way to the ocean, where they spend several years maturing to adulthood. As adults, the salmon return to the streams where they were born in order to spawn, ensuring the continuation of their species by depositing their eggs in the gravel of the stream beds. Both male and female salmon die shortly after supplying the river habitat with the next generation of salmon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout their migration, salmon support a wide range of organisms in the ecosystems they pass through. For example, salmon bring nutrients like carbon and nitrogen from the ocean upriver, enhancing their availability to those ecosystems. In addition, salmon are key to many predator-prey relationships: They serve as a food source for various predators, such as bears, wolves, and birds, while helping to control other populations, like insects, through predation. After they die from spawning, the decomposing salmon carcasses also replenish valuable nutrients to the surrounding ecosystem. The migration of salmon not only sustains their own species but plays a critical role in the overall health of the rivers and oceans they inhabit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, salmon populations play an important role both economically and culturally in the region. Commercial and recreational salmon fisheries contribute significantly to the local economy. And for many Indigenous peoples in the Pacific northwest, salmon hold notable cultural value, as they have been central to their diets, traditions, and ceremonies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring salmon migration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Increased human activity, including overfishing and hydropower development, together with habitat loss and climate change, have had a significant impact on salmon populations in the region. As a result, effective monitoring and management of salmon fisheries is important to ensure balance among competing ecological, cultural, and human interests. Accurately counting salmon during their seasonal migration to their natal river to spawn is essential in order to track threatened populations, assess the success of recovery strategies, guide fishing season regulations, and support the management of both commercial and recreational fisheries. Precise population data help decision-makers employ the best strategies to safeguard the health of the ecosystem while accommodating human needs. Monitoring salmon migration is a labor-intensive and inefficient undertaking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beery is currently leading a research project that aims to streamline salmon monitoring using cutting-edge computer vision methods. This project fits within Beery’s broader research interest, which focuses on the interdisciplinary space between artificial intelligence, the natural world, and sustainability. Its relevance to fisheries management made it a good fit for funding from MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS). Beery’s 2023 J-WAFS seed grant was the first research funding she was awarded since joining the MIT faculty. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historically, monitoring efforts relied on humans to manually count salmon from riverbanks using eyesight. In the past few decades, underwater sonar systems have been implemented to aid in counting the salmon. These sonar systems are essentially underwater video cameras, but they differ in that they use acoustics instead of light sensors to capture the presence of a fish. Use of this method requires people to set up a tent alongside the river to count salmon based on the output of a sonar camera that is hooked up to a laptop. While this system is an improvement to the original method of monitoring salmon by eyesight, it still relies significantly on human effort and is an arduous and time-consuming process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Automating salmon monitoring is necessary for better management of salmon fisheries. “We need these technological tools,” says Beery. “We can’t keep up with the demand of monitoring and understanding and studying these really complex ecosystems that we work in without some form of automation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to automate counting of migrating salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest, the project team, including Justin Kay, a PhD student in EECS, has been collecting data in the form of videos from sonar cameras at different rivers. The team annotates a subset of the data to train the computer vision system to autonomously detect and count the fish as they migrate. Kay describes the process of how the model counts each migrating fish: “The computer vision algorithm is designed to locate a fish in the frame, draw a box around it, and then track it over time. If a fish is detected on one side of the screen and leaves on the other side of the screen, then we count it as moving upstream.” On rivers where the team has created training data for the system, it has produced strong results, with only 3 to 5 percent counting error. This is well below the target that the team and partnering stakeholders set of no more than a 10 percent counting error.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing and deployment: Balancing human effort and use of automation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers’ technology is being deployed to monitor the migration of salmon on the newly restored Klamath River. Four dams on the river were recently demolished, making it the largest dam removal project in U.S. history. The dams came down after a more than 20-year-long campaign to remove them, which was led by Klamath tribes, in collaboration with scientists, environmental organizations, and commercial fishermen. After the removal of the dams, 240 miles of the river now flow freely and nearly 800 square miles of habitat are accessible to salmon. Beery notes the almost immediate regeneration of salmon populations in the Klamath River: “I think it was within eight days of the dam coming down, they started seeing salmon actually migrate upriver beyond the dam.” In a collaboration with California Trout, the team is currently processing new data to adapt and create a customized model that can then be deployed to help count the newly migrating salmon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One challenge with the system revolves around training the model to accurately count the fish in unfamiliar environments with variations such as riverbed features, water clarity, and lighting conditions. These factors can significantly alter how the fish appear on the output of a sonar camera and confuse the computer model. When deployed in new rivers where no data have been collected before, like the Klamath, the performance of the system degrades and the margin of error increases substantially to 15-20 percent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers constructed an automatic adaptation algorithm within the system to overcome this challenge and create a scalable system that can be deployed to any site without human intervention. This self-initializing technology works to automatically calibrate to the new conditions and environment to accurately count the migrating fish. In testing, the automatic adaptation algorithm was able to reduce the counting error down to the 10 to 15 percent range. The improvement in counting error with the self-initializing function means that the technology is closer to being deployable to new locations without much additional human effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enabling real-time management with the “Fishbox”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another challenge faced by the research team was the development of an efficient data infrastructure. In order to run the computer vision system, the video produced by sonar cameras must be delivered via the cloud or by manually mailing hard drives from a river site to the lab. These methods have notable drawbacks: a cloud-based approach is limited due to lack of internet connectivity in remote river site locations, and shipping the data introduces problems of delay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of relying on these methods, the team has implemented a power-efficient computer, coined the “Fishbox,” that can be used in the field to perform the processing. The Fishbox consists of a small, lightweight computer with optimized software that fishery managers can plug into their existing laptops and sonar cameras. The system is then capable of running salmon counting models directly at the sonar sites without the need for internet connectivity. This allows managers to make hour-by-hour decisions, supporting more responsive, real-time management of salmon populations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team is also working to bring a community together around monitoring for salmon fisheries management in the Pacific Northwest. “It’s just pretty exciting to have stakeholders who are enthusiastic about getting access to [our technology] as we get it to work and having a tighter integration and collaboration with them,” says Beery. “I think particularly when you’re working on food and water systems, you need direct collaboration to help facilitate impact, because you're ensuring that what you develop is actually serving the needs of the people and organizations that you are helping to support.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This past June, Beery’s lab organized a workshop in Seattle that convened nongovernmental organizations, tribes, and state and federal departments of fish and wildlife to discuss the use of automated sonar systems to monitor and manage salmon populations. Kay notes that the workshop was an “awesome opportunity to have everybody sharing different ways that they're using sonar and thinking about how the automated methods that we’re building could fit into that workflow.” The discussion continues now via a shared Slack channel created by the team, with over 50 participants. Convening this group is a significant achievement, as many of these organizations would not otherwise have had an opportunity to come together and collaborate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team continues to tune the computer vision system, refine their technology, and engage with diverse stakeholders — from Indigenous communities to fishery managers — the project is poised to make significant improvements to the efficiency and accuracy of salmon monitoring and management in the region. And as Beery advances the work of her MIT group, the J-WAFS seed grant is helping to keep challenges such as fisheries management in her sights. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that the J-WAFS seed grant existed here at MIT enabled us to continue to work on this project when we moved here,” comments Beery, adding “it also expanded the scope of the project and allowed us to maintain active collaboration on what I think is a really important and impactful project.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS marks its 10th anniversary this year, the program aims to continue supporting and encouraging MIT faculty to pursue innovative projects that aim to advance knowledge and create practical solutions with real-world impacts on global water and food system challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In India, many kids who work in retail markets have good math skills: They can quickly perform a range of calculations to complete transactions. But as a new study shows, these kids often perform much worse on the same kinds of problems as they are taught in the classroom. This happens even though many of these students still attend school or attended school through 7th or 8th grades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the study also finds, Indian students who are still enrolled in school and don’t have jobs do better on school-type math problems, but they often fare poorly at the kinds of problems that occur in marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, both the “market kids” and the “school kids” struggle with the approach the other group is proficient in, raising questions about how to help both groups learn math more comprehensively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the school kids, they do worse when you go from an abstract problem to a concrete problem,” says MIT economist Esther Duflo, co-author of a new paper detailing the study’s results. “For the market kids, it’s the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the kids with jobs who are also in school “underperform despite being extraordinarily good at mental math,” says Abhijit Banerjee an MIT economist and another co-author of the paper. “That for me was always the revelation, that the one doesn’t translate into the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08502-w" target="_blank"&gt;Children’s arithmetic skills do not transfer between applied and academic math&lt;/a&gt;,” is published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The authors are&amp;nbsp;Banerjee, the Ford Professor of Economics at MIT; Swati Bhattacharjee of the newspaper &lt;em&gt;Ananda Bazar Patrika,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;in Kolkata, India; Raghabendra Chattopadhyay of the Indian Institute of Management in Kolkata; Duflo, the Abdul Latif Jameel Professor of Poverty Alleviation and Development Economics at MIT;&amp;nbsp;Alejandro J. Ganimian, a professor of applied psychology and economics at New York University; Kailash Rajaha, a doctoral candidate in economics at MIT; and Elizabeth S. Spelke, a professor of psychology at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duflo and Banerjee &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/esther-duflo-abhijit-banerjee-win-2019-nobel-prize-economics-1014" target="_blank"&gt;shared the Nobel Prize in Economics&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and are co-founders of MIT’s Jameel Abdul Latif Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), a global leader in development economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three experiments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study consists largely of three data-collection exercises with some embedded experiments. The first one shows that 201 kids working in markets in Kolkata do have good math skills. For instance, a researcher, posing as an ordinary shopper, would ask for the cost of 800 grams of potatoes sold at 20 rupees per kilogram, then ask for the cost of 1.4 kilograms of onions sold at 15 rupees per kilo. They would request the combined answer — 37 rupees —&amp;nbsp; then hand the market worker a 200 rupee note and collect 163 rupees back. All told, the kids working in markets correctly solved this kind of problem from 95 to 98 percent of the time by the second try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the working children were pulled aside (with their parents’ permission) and given a standardized Indian national math test, just 32 percent could correctly divide a three-digit number by a one-digit number, and just 54 percent could correctly subtract a two-digit number from another two-digit number two times. Clearly, the kids’ skills were not yielding classroom results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then conducted a second study with 400 kids working in markets in Delhi, which replicated the results: Working kids had a strong ability to handle market transactions, but only about 15 percent of the ones also in school were at average proficiency in math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second study, the researchers also asked the reverse question: How do students doing well in school fare at market math problems? Here, with 200 students from 17 Delhi schools who do not work in markets, they found that 96 percent of the students could solve typical problems with a pencil, paper, unlimited time, and one opportunity to self-correct. But when the students had to solve the problems in a make-believe “market” setting, that figure dropped to just 60 percent.&amp;nbsp;The students had unlimited time and access to paper and pencil, so that figure may actually overestimate how they would fare in a market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in a third study, conducted in Delhi with over 200 kids, the researchers compared the performances of both “market” and “school” kids again on numerous math problems in varying conditions. While 85 percent of the working kids got the right answer to a market transaction problem, only 10 percent of nonworking kids correctly answered a&amp;nbsp;question of similar difficulty, when faced with limited time and with no aids like pencil and paper.&amp;nbsp;However, given the same division and subtraction problems, but with pencil and paper, 59 percent of nonmarket kids got them right, compared to 45 percent of market kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further evaluate market kids and school kids on a level playing field, the researchers then presented each group with a word problem about a boy going to the market and buying two vegetables. Roughly one-third of the market kids were able to solve this without any aid, while fewer than 1 percent of the school kids did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why might the performance of the nonworking students decline when given a problem in market conditions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They learned an algorithm but didn’t understand it,” Banerjee says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the market kids seemed to use certain tactics to handle retail transactions. For one thing, they appear to use rounding well. Take a problem like 43 times 11. To handle that intuitively, you might multiply 43 times 10, and then add 43, for the final answer of 473. This appears to be what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The market kids are able to exploit base 10, so they do better on base 10 problems,” Duflo says. “The school kids have no idea. It makes no difference to them.&amp;nbsp;The market kids may have additional tricks of this sort that we did not see.” On the other hand, the school kids had a better grasp of formal written methods of division, subtraction, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going farther in school&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings raise a significant point about students skills and academic progress. While it is a good thing that the kids with market jobs are proficient at generating rapid answers, it would likely be better for the long-term futures if they also did well in school and wound up with a high school degree or better. Finding a way to cross the divide between informal and formal ways of tackling math problems, then, could notably help some Indian children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that such a divide exists, meanwhile, suggests some new approaches could be tried in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banerjee, for one, suspects that part of the issue is a classroom process making it seem as if there is only one true route to funding an arithmetic answer. Instead, he believes, following the work of co-author Spelke, that helping students reason their way to an approximation of the right answer can help them truly get a handle on what is needed to solve these types of problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Duflo adds, “We don’t want to blame the teachers. It’s not their fault. They are given a strict curriculum to follow, and strict methods to follow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That still leaves open the question of what to change, in concrete classroom terms. That topic, it happens, is something the research group is in the process of weighing, as they consider new experiments that might address it directly. The current finding, however, makes clear progress would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight the importance of educational curricula that bridge the gap between intuitive and formal mathematics,” the authors state in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for the research was provided, in part, by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab’s Post-Primary Education Initiative, the Foundation Blaise Pascal, and the AXA Research Fund.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senior Audrey Lorvo is researching AI safety, which seeks to ensure increasingly intelligent AI models are reliable and can benefit humanity.&amp;nbsp;The growing field focuses on technical challenges like robustness and AI alignment with human values, as well as societal concerns like transparency and accountability. Practitioners are also concerned with the potential existential risks associated with increasingly powerful AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Ensuring AI isn’t misused or acts contrary to our intentions is increasingly important as we approach artificial general intelligence (AGI),” says Lorvo, a &lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-14-computer-science-economics-and-data-science/" target="_blank"&gt;computer science, economics, and data science&lt;/a&gt; major. AGI describes the potential of artificial intelligence to match or surpass human cognitive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;An MIT Schwarzman College of Computing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/serc-scholars-program/"&gt;Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC) scholar&lt;/a&gt;, Lorvo looks closely at how AI might automate AI research and development processes and practices. A member of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/serc-projects/"&gt;Big Data research group&lt;/a&gt;, she’s investigating the social and economic implications associated with AI’s potential to accelerate research on itself and how to effectively communicate these ideas and potential impacts to general audiences including legislators, strategic advisors, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lorvo emphasizes the need to critically assess AI’s rapid advancements and their implications, ensuring organizations have proper frameworks and strategies in place to address risks. “We need to both ensure humans reap AI’s benefits and that we don’t lose control of the technology,” she says. “We need to do all we can to develop it safely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Her participation in efforts like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://haist.ai/tech-fellowship"&gt;AI Safety Technical Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; reflect her investment in understanding the technical aspects of AI safety. The fellowship provides opportunities to review existing research on aligning AI development with considerations of potential human impact. “The fellowship helped me understand AI safety’s technical questions and challenges so I can potentially propose better AI governance strategies,” she says. According to Lorvo, companies on AI’s frontier continue to push boundaries, which means we’ll need to implement effective policies that prioritize human safety without impeding research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value from human engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When arriving at MIT, Lorvo knew she wanted to pursue a course of study that would allow her to work at the intersection of science and the humanities. The variety of offerings at the Institute made her choices difficult, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are so many ways to help advance the quality of life for individuals and communities,” she says, “and MIT offers so many different paths for investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beginning with economics — a discipline she enjoys because of its focus on quantifying impact — Lorvo investigated math, political science, and urban planning before choosing Course 6-14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/josh-angrist"&gt;Joshua Angrist’s&lt;/a&gt; econometrics classes helped me see the value in focusing on economics, while the data science and computer science elements appealed to me because of the growing reach and potential impact of AI,” she says. “We can use these tools to tackle some of the world’s most pressing problems and hopefully overcome serious challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lorvo has also pursued concentrations in &lt;a href="https://dusp.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;urban studies and planning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/international-development" target="_blank"&gt;international development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As she’s narrowed her focus, Lorvo finds she shares an outlook on humanity with other members of the MIT community like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://aialignment.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT AI Alignment group&lt;/a&gt;, from whom she learned quite a bit about AI safety. “Students care about their marginal impact,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Marginal impact, the additional effect of a specific investment of time, money, or effort,&amp;nbsp;is a way to measure how much a contribution adds to what is already being done, rather than focusing on the total impact. This can potentially influence where people choose to devote their resources, an idea that appeals to Lorvo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“In a world of limited resources, a data-driven approach to solving some of our biggest challenges can benefit from a tailored approach that directs people to where they’re likely to do the most good,” she says.&amp;nbsp;“If you want to maximize your social impact, reflecting on your career choice’s marginal impact can be very valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lorvo also values MIT’s focus on educating the whole student and has taken advantage of opportunities to investigate disciplines like philosophy through&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://concourse.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Concourse&lt;/a&gt;, a program that facilitates dialogue between science and the humanities. Concourse hopes participants gain guidance, clarity, and purpose for scientific, technical, and human pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student experiences at the Institute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lorvo invests her time outside the classroom in creating memorable experiences and fostering relationships with her classmates. “I’m fortunate that there’s space to balance my coursework, research, and club commitments with other activities, like weightlifting and off-campus initiatives,” she says. “There are always so many clubs and events available across the Institute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These opportunities to expand her worldview have challenged her beliefs and exposed her to new interest areas that have altered her life and career choices for the better. Lorvo, who is fluent in French, English, Spanish, and Portuguese, also applauds MIT for the international experiences it provides for students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I’ve interned in Santiago de Chile and Paris with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/"&gt;MISTI&lt;/a&gt; and helped&amp;nbsp;test a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/news-blog/blog/we-move-it-move-it-madagascar-testing-water-vapor-condensing-chamber"&gt;water vapor condensing chamber&lt;/a&gt; that we designed in a fall 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/"&gt;D-Lab&lt;/a&gt; class in collaboration with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.univ-antananarivo.mg/Ecole-Normale-Superieure-d-Antananarivo"&gt;Madagascar Polytechnic School&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://tatirano.org/"&gt;Tatirano NGO&lt;/a&gt; [nongovernmental organization],” she says, “and have enjoyed the opportunities to learn about addressing economic inequality through my International Development and D-Lab classes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As president of MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mit-uea.github.io/"&gt;Undergraduate Economics Association&lt;/a&gt;, Lorvo connects with other students interested in economics while continuing to expand her understanding of the field. She enjoys the relationships she’s building while also participating in the association’s events throughout the year. “Even as a senior, I’ve found new campus communities to explore and appreciate,” she says. “I encourage other students to continue exploring groups and classes that spark their interests throughout their time at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;After graduation, Lorvo wants to continue investigating AI safety and researching governance strategies that can help ensure AI’s safe and effective deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Good governance is essential to AI’s successful development and ensuring humanity can benefit from its transformative potential,” she says. “We must continue to monitor AI’s growth and capabilities as the technology continues to evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Understanding technology’s potential impacts on humanity, doing good, continually improving, and creating spaces where big ideas can see the light of day continue to drive Lorvo. Merging the humanities with the sciences animates much of what she does. “I always hoped to contribute to improving people’s lives, and AI represents humanity’s greatest challenge and opportunity yet,” she says. “I believe the AI safety field can benefit from people with interdisciplinary experiences like the kind I’ve been fortunate to gain, and I encourage anyone passionate about shaping the future to explore it.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>3 Questions: Community policing in the Global South</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/3-questions-community-policing-global-south-1204</link>
  <description><![CDATA[International research co-led by Professor Fotini Christia finds an approach lauded in the US works differently in other regions.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The concept of community policing gained wide acclaim in the U.S. when crime dropped drastically during the 1990s. In Chicago, Boston, and elsewhere, police departments established programs to build more local relationships, to better enhance community security. But how well does community policing work in other places? A new multicountry experiment co-led by MIT political scientist Fotini Christia found, perhaps surprisingly, that the policy had no impact in several countries across the Global South, from Africa to South America and Asia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The results are detailed in a new edited volume, “Crime, Insecurity, and Community Policing: Experiments on Building Trust,” published this week by Cambridge University Press. The editors are Christia, the Ford International Professor of the Social Sciences in MIT’s Department of Political Science, director of the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society, and director of the MIT Sociotechnical Systems Research Center; Graeme Blair of the University of California at Los Angeles; and Jeremy M. Weinstein of Stanford University.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; talked to Christia about the project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is community policing, and how and where did you study it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The general idea is that community policing, actually connecting the police and the community they are serving in direct ways, is very effective. Many of us have celebrated community policing, and we typically think of the 1990s Chicago and Boston experiences, where community policing was implemented and seen as wildly successful in reducing crime rates, gang violence, and homicide.&amp;nbsp;This model has been broadly exported across the world, even though we don’t have much evidence that it works in contexts that have different resource capacities and institutional footprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study aims to understand if the hype around community policing is justified by measuring the effects of such policies globally, through field experiments, in six different settings in the Global South. In the same way that MIT’s &lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/" target="_blank"&gt;J-PAL&lt;/a&gt; develops field experiments about an array of development interventions, we created programs, in cooperation with local governments, about policing. We studied if it works and how, across very diverse settings, including Uganda and Liberia in Africa, Colombia and Brazil in Latin America, and the Philippines and Pakistan in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, and book, is the result of collaborations with many police agencies. We also highlight how one can work with the police to understand and refine police practices&amp;nbsp;and think very intentionally about all the ethical considerations around such collaborations. The researchers designed the interventions alongside six teams of academics who conducted the experiments, so the book also reflects an interesting experiment in how to put together a collaboration like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What did you find?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; What was fascinating was that we found that locally designed community policing interventions did not generate greater trust or cooperation between citizens and the police, and did not reduce crime in the six regions of the Global South where we carried out our research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We looked at an array of different measures to evaluate the impact, such as changes in crime victimization, perceptions of police, as well as crime reporting, among others, and did not see any reductions in crime, whether measured in administrative data or in victimization surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The null effects were not driven by concerns of police noncompliance with the intervention, crime displacement, or any heterogeneity in effects across sites, including individual experiences with the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there is a bias against publishing so-called null results. But because we could show that it wasn’t due to methodological concerns, and because we were able to explain how such changes in resource-constrained environments would have to be preceded by structural reforms, the finding has been received as particularly compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why did community policing not have an impact in these countries?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; We felt that it was important to analyze why it doesn’t work. In the book, we highlight three challenges. One involves capacity issues: This is the developing world, and there are low-resource issues to begin with, in terms of the programs police can implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second challenge is the principal-agent problem, the fact that the incentives of the police may not align in this case. For example,&amp;nbsp;a station commander and supervisors may not appreciate the importance of adopting community policing, and line officers&amp;nbsp;might not comply. Agency problems within the police are complex when it comes to mechanisms of accountability, and this may undermine the effectiveness of community policing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third challenge we highlight is the fact that, to the communities they serve, the police might not seem separate from the actual government.&amp;nbsp;So, it may not be clear if police are seen as independent institutions acting in the best interest of the citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We faced a lot of pushback when we were first presenting our results. The potential benefits of community policing is a story that resonates with many of us; it’s a narrative suggesting that connecting the police to a community has a&amp;nbsp;significant and substantively positive effect. But the outcome didn’t come as a surprise to people from the Global South. They felt the lack of resources, and potential problems about autonomy and nonalignment, were real.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>From refugee to MIT graduate student</title>

  <description><![CDATA[As a child, a civil war drove Mlen-Too Wesley out of Liberia. As an adult, he has returned and is applying what he learned in an MITx MicroMasters program to help the West African nation thrive. ]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Marisa Demers | MIT Open Learning</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mlen-Too Wesley has faded memories of his early childhood in Liberia, but the sharpest one has shaped his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wesley was 4 years old when he and his family boarded a military airplane to flee the West African nation. At the time, the country was embroiled in a 14-year civil war that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Mar/20/2003416574/-1/-1/0/20240306_LIBERIANCIVILWAR_1989-96.PDF"&gt;killed&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;approximately 200,000 people,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/stories/unhcr-completes-repatriation-155-000-liberians#:~:text=During%20Liberia%27s%20civil%20war%2C%20which%20broke%20out%20in%20December%201989%2C%20some%20750%2C000%20civilians%20became%20either%20internally%20displaced%20or%20refugees.%20Some%20refugees%20spent%20more%20than%20two%20decades%20in%20countries%20such%20as%20C%C3%B4te%20d%27Ivoire%2C%20the%20Gambia%2C%20Ghana%2C%20Guinea%2C%20Mali%2C%20Nigeria%2C%20Sierra%20Leone%20and%20Togo"&gt;displaced&lt;/a&gt; about 750,000, and starved countless more. When Wesley’s grandmother told him he would enjoy a meal during his flight, Wesley knew his fortune had changed. Yet, his first instinct was to&amp;nbsp;offer his food to the people he left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I made a decision right then to come back,” Wesley says. “Even as I grew older and spent more time in the United States, I knew I wanted to contribute to Liberia’s future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today, the 38-year-old is committed to empowering Liberians through economic growth. Wesley looked to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/"&gt;MITx MicroMasters program in Data, Economics, and Design of Policy&lt;/a&gt; (DEDP) to achieve that goal. He examined issues such as micro-lending, state capture, and investment in health care in courses such as &lt;a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+14.740x/" target="_blank"&gt;Foundations of Development Policy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+14.009x/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Economics for Hard Times&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+14.73x/" target="_blank"&gt;The Challenges of Global Poverty&lt;/a&gt;. Through case studies and research, Wesley discovered that economic incentives can encourage desired behaviors, curb corruption, and empower people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I couldn’t connect the dots”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Liberia is marred by corruption. According to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://images.transparencycdn.org/images/CPI-2023-Report.pdf"&gt;Transparency International’s Corruptions Perception Index for 2023&lt;/a&gt;, Liberia scored 25 out of 100, with zero signifying the highest level of corruption. Yet, Wesley grew tired of textbooks and undergraduate professors saying that the status of Liberia and other African nations could be blamed entirely on corruption. Even worse, these sources gave Wesley the impression that nothing could be done to improve his native country. The sentiment frustrated him, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It struck me as flippant to attribute the challenges faced by billions of people to backward behaviors,” says Wesley. “There are several forces, internal and external, that have contributed to Liberia’s condition. If we really examine them, explore why things happened, and define the change we want, we can plot a way forward to a more prosperous future.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Driven to examine the economic, political, and social dynamics shaping his homeland and to fulfill his childhood promise, Wesley moved back to Africa in 2013. Over the next 10 years, he merged his interests in entrepreneurship, software development, and economics to better Liberia. He designed a forestry management platform that preserves Liberia’s natural resources, built an online queue for government hospitals to triage patients more effectively, and engineered data visualization tools to support renewable energy initiatives. Yet, to create the impact Wesley wanted, he needed to do more than collect data. He had to analyze and act on it in meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I couldn’t connect the dots on why things are the way they are,” Wesley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It wasn't just an academic experience for me”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wesley knew he needed to dive deeper into data science, and looked to the MicroMasters in DEDP program to help him connect the dots. Established in 2017 by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) and MIT Open Learning, the MicroMasters in DEDP program is based on the Nobel Prize-winning work of MIT faculty members Esther Duflo, the Abdul Latif Jameel Professor of Poverty Alleviation and Development Economics, and Abhijit Banerjee, the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics. Duflo and Banerjee’s research provided an entirely new approach to designing, implementing, and evaluating antipoverty initiatives throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The MicroMasters in DEDP program provided the framework Wesley had sought nearly 20 years ago as an undergraduate student. He learned about novel economic incentives that stymied corruption and promoted education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It wasn't just an academic experience for me,” Wesley says. “The classes gave me the tools and the frameworks to analyze my own personal experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Wesley initially stumbled with the quantitative coursework. Having a demanding career, taking extension courses at another university, and being several years removed from college calculus courses took a toll on him. He had to retake some classes, especially&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+14.310x/"&gt;Data Analysis for Social Scientists&lt;/a&gt;, several times before he could pass the proctored exam. His persistence paid off. Wesley earned his MicroMasters in DEDP credential in June 2023 and was also admitted into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/academic-programs/masters-programs/masters-data-economics-and-design-policy-dedp"&gt;MIT DEDP master’s program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The class twisted my brain in so many different ways,” Wesley says. “The fourth time taking Data Analysis, I began to understand it. I appreciate that MIT did not care that I did poorly on my first try. They cared that over time I understood the material.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The program’s rigorous mathematics and statistics classes sparked in Wesley a passion for artificial intelligence, especially machine learning and natural language processing. Both provide more powerful ways to extract and interpret data, and Wesley has a special interest in mining qualitative sources for information. He plans to use these tools to compare national development plans over time and among different countries to determine if policymakers are recycling the same words and goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once Wesley earns his master’s degree, he plans to return to Liberia and focus on international development. In the future, he hopes to lead a data-focused organization committed to improving the lives of people in Liberia and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Thanks to MIT, I have the knowledge and tools to tackle real-world challenges that traditional economic models often overlook,” Wesley says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Victoria Moura | J-PAL North America</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;J-PAL North America recently selected government partners for the 2024-25&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lever"&gt;Leveraging Evaluation and Evidence for Equitable Recovery&lt;/a&gt; (LEVER) Evaluation Incubator cohort. Selected collaborators will receive funding and technical assistance to develop or launch a randomized evaluation for one of their programs. These collaborations represent jurisdictions across the United States and demonstrate the growing enthusiasm for evidence-based policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Launched in 2023, LEVER is a joint venture between &lt;a href="http://povertyactionlab.org/na"&gt;J-PAL North America&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://results4america.org/"&gt;Results for America.&lt;/a&gt; Through the Evaluation Incubator,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lever/training-sprint"&gt;trainings&lt;/a&gt;, and other program offerings, LEVER seeks to address the barriers many state and local governments face around finding and generating evidence to inform program design. LEVER offers government leaders the opportunity to learn&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://results4america.org/tools/evaluation-policy-guide/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Eval+Policy+Guide+24"&gt;best practices for policy evaluations&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://results4america.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Results-for-America_Evaluation-Policy-Practices-Checklist.pdf"&gt;how to integrate evidence into decision-making&lt;/a&gt;. Since the program’s inception, more than 80 government jurisdictions have participated in LEVER offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;J-PAL North America’s Evaluation Incubator helps collaborators turn policy-relevant research questions into well-designed randomized evaluations, generating rigorous evidence to inform pressing programmatic and policy decisions. The program also aims to build a culture of evidence use and give government partners the tools to continue generating and utilizing evidence in their day-to-day operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to funding and technical assistance, the selected state and local government collaborators will be connected with researchers from J-PAL’s network to help advance their evaluation ideas. Evaluation support will also be centered on community-engaged research practices, which emphasize collaborating with and learning from the groups most affected by the program being evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation Incubator selected projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.piercecountywa.gov/hs"&gt;Pierce County Human Services&lt;/a&gt; (PCHS) in the state of Washington will evaluate two programs as part of the Evaluation Incubator. The first will examine how extending stays in a fentanyl detox program affects the successful completion of inpatient treatment and hospital utilization for individuals. “PCHS is interested in evaluating longer fentanyl detox stays to inform our funding decisions, streamline our resource utilization, and encourage additional financial commitments to address the unmet needs of individuals dealing with opioid use disorder,” says Trish Crocker, grant coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The second PCHS program will evaluate the impact of providing medication and outreach services via a mobile distribution unit to individuals with opioid use disorders on program take-up and substance usage. Margo Burnison, a behavioral health manager with PCHS, says that the team is “thrilled to be partnering with J-PAL North America to dive deep into the data to inform our elected leaders on the best way to utilize available resources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The City of Los Angeles&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ydd.lacity.gov/research"&gt;Youth Development Department&lt;/a&gt; (YDD) seeks to evaluate a research-informed program:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://socialjustice.usc.edu/student-engagement-exploration-and-development-seeds/"&gt;Student Engagement, Exploration, and Development in STEM&lt;/a&gt; (SEEDS). This intergenerational STEM mentorship program supports underrepresented middle school and college students in STEM by providing culturally responsive mentorship. The program seeks to foster these students’ STEM identity and degree attainment in higher education. YDD has been working with researchers at the University of Southern California to measure the SEEDS program’s impact, but is interested in developing a randomized evaluation to generate further evidence. Darnell Cole, professor and co-director of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://socialjustice.usc.edu/"&gt;Research Center for Education, Identity and Social Justice&lt;/a&gt;, shares his excitement about the collaboration with J-PAL: “We welcome the opportunity to measure the impact of the SEEDS program on our students’ educational experience. Rigorously testing the SEEDS program will help us improve support for STEM students, ultimately enhancing their persistence and success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Fort Wayne Police Department’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.fwpd.org/divisions/h-a-r-t"&gt;Hope and Recovery Team&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana will evaluate the impact of two programs that connect social workers with people who have experienced an overdose, or who have a mental health illness, to treatment and resources. “We believe we are on the right track in the work we are doing with the crisis intervention social worker and the recovery coach, but having an outside evaluation of both programs would be extremely helpful in understanding whether and what aspects of these programs are most effective,” says Police Captain Kevin Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/"&gt;County of San Diego&lt;/a&gt;’s Office of Evaluation, Performance and Analytics, and Planning &amp;amp; Development Services will engage with J-PAL staff to explore evaluation opportunities for two programs that are a part of the county’s Climate Action Plan. The Equity-Driven Tree Planting Program seeks to increase tree canopy coverage, and the Climate Smart Land Stewardship Program will encourage climate-smart agricultural practices. Ricardo Basurto-Davila, chief evaluation officer, says that “the county is dedicated to evidence-based policymaking and taking decisive action against climate change. The work with J-PAL will support us in combining these commitments to maximize the effectiveness in decreasing emissions through these programs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;J-PAL North America looks forward to working with the selected collaborators in the coming months to learn more about these promising programs, clarify our partner’s evidence goals, and design randomized evaluations to measure their impact.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>“Mens et manus” in Guatemala</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a new, well-equipped lab at the University del Valle de Guatemala (UVG) in June 2024, members of two Mayan farmers’ cooperatives watched closely as Rodrigo Aragón, professor of mechanical engineering at UVG, demonstrated the operation of an industrial ultrasound machine. Then he invited each of them to test the device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For us, it is a dream to be able to interact with technology,” said Francisca Elizabeth Saloj Saloj, a member of the Ija´tz women’s collective, a group from Guatemala’s highlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a seven-hour bumpy bus ride, the farmers had arrived in Guatemala City with sacks full of rosemary, chamomile, and thyme. Their objective: to explore processes for extracting essential oils from their plants and to identify new products to manufacture with these oils. Currently, farmers sell their herbs in local markets for medicinal or culinary purposes. With new technology, says Aragón, they can add value to their harvest, using herb oils as the basis for perfumes, syrups, and tinctures that would reach broader markets. These goods could provide much-needed income to the farmers’ households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strategy for transformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collaboration is just one part of a five-year, $15-million project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and managed by MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering in collaboration with UVG and the Guatemalan Export Association (AGEXPORT). Launched in 2021 and called ASPIRE — Achieving Sustainable Partnerships for Innovation, Research, and Entrepreneurship — the project aims to collaboratively strengthen UVG, and eventually other universities in Central America, as problem-solving powerhouses that research, design, and build solutions with and for the people most in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vision of ASPIRE is that within a decade, UVG researchers are collaborating with community members on research that generates results that are relevant to addressing local development challenges — results that are picked up and used by policymakers and actors in the private sector,” says MIT Research Scientist Elizabeth Hoffecker, a co-principal investigator of ASPIRE at MIT, and leader of the Institute’s Local Innovation Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UVG, one of Guatemala’s top universities, has embraced ASPIRE as part of its long-term strategic plan, and is now pursuing wide-ranging changes based on a playbook developed at MIT — including at MIT D-Lab, which deploys participatory design, co-creation, low-cost technologies, and capacity building to meet the complex challenges of poverty — and piloted at UVG. The ASPIRE team is working to extend the reach of its research innovation and entrepreneurship activities to its two regional campuses and to other regional universities.&amp;nbsp;The overall program is informed by MIT’s approach to development of research-driven innovation ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although lacking the resources (and PhD programs) of a typical U.S. university, UVG has big ambitions for itself, and for Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to thrive and lead the country in research and teaching, and to accomplish this, we are creating an innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem, based on best practices drawn from D-Lab and other MIT groups,” says Mónica Stein, vice-rector for research and outreach at UVG, who holds a doctorate from Stanford University in plant biology. “ASPIRE can really change the way that development work and local research is done so that it has more impact,” says Stein. “And in theory, if you have more impact, then you improve environmental outcomes, health outcomes, educational outcomes, and economic outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local innovation and entrepreneurship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting gears at a university and launching novel development initiatives are complex challenges, but with training and workshops conducted by D-Lab-trained collaborators and MIT-based ASPIRE staff, UVG faculty, staff, and students are embracing the change. Programs underway should sound familiar to anyone who has set foot recently on the campus of a U.S. research university: hackathons, makerspaces, pitchapaloozas, entrepreneurship competitions, and spinouts. But at UVG, all of these serve a larger purpose: addressing sustainable development goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASPIRE principal investigator Daniel Frey, professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, believes some of these programs are already paying off, particularly a UVG venture mentoring service (UVG-EMS), modeled after and facilitated by MIT’s own &lt;a href="https://vms.mit.edu/"&gt;VMS program&lt;/a&gt;. “We’d like to see students building companies and improving their livelihoods and those of people from indigenous and marginalized communities,” says Frey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASPIRE project intends to enable the lowest-income communities to share more of Guatemala’s wealth, derived mainly from agricultural goods. In collaborating with AGEXPORT, which enables networking with companies across the country, the team zeroed in on creating or enhancing the value chain for several key crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Snow peas offer a great target for both research and innovation,” says Adilia Blandón, ASPIRE research project manager and professor of food engineering at UVG. Many farming communities grow snow peas, which they send along to companies for export to the U.S. Unless these peas are perfect in shape and color, Blandón explains, they don’t make it to market. Nearly a third of Guatemala’s crop is left at processing plants, turned into animal feed, or wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ASPIRE snow pea team located farmers from two cooperatives who wanted to solve this problem. At a series of co-creation sessions, these growers and mechanical engineers at UVG developed a prototype for a low-tech cart for collecting snow peas, made from easily acquired local materials, which can navigate the steep and narrow paths on the hills where the plants grow. This method avoids crushing snow peas in a conventional harvest bag. In addition, the snow pea project has engaged women at a technical school to design a harvest apron for women snow pea farmers. “This could be a business opportunity for them,” Blandón says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blandón vividly recalls her first ASPIRE workshop, focused on participatory design. “It opened my eyes as a researcher in so many ways,” she says. “I learned that instead of taking information from people, I can learn from them and create things with them that they are really excited about.” It completely changed how she approaches research, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with Mayan communities that produce snow peas, where malnourishment and illness are rampant, Blandón and ASPIRE researchers found that families don’t eat the protein-packed vegetable because they don’t find it palatable — even though so much of it is left over from harvest. Participatory design sessions with a group of mothers yielded an intriguing possibility: grinding snow peas into flour, which would then be incorporated into traditional bean- and corn-based dishes. The recipes born of this collaboration could land on WhatsApp or TikTok, mobile apps familiar to these families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building value chains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional research projects are teasing out novel ways of adding value to the products grown or made by Guatemalan hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include an educational toolkit developed with government farm extension workers to teach avocado producers how to improve their practices. The long-term goal is to grow and export larger and unblemished fruit for the lucrative U.S. market, currently dominated by Mexico. The kit, featuring simple graphics for growers who can’t read or don’t have the time, offers lessons on soil care, fertilizing, and protecting the fruit post-harvest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASPIRE UVG Research Director Ana Lucia Solano is especially proud of “an immersive, animated, Monopoly-like game that shows farmers the impact of activities like buying fertilizer on their finances,” she says.&amp;nbsp;“If small producers improve their practices, they will have better opportunities to sell their products at a better price, which may allow them to hire more people, teach others more easily, and offer better jobs and working conditions — and maybe this will help prevent farmworkers from having to leave the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solano has just begun a similar program to educate cocoa producers. “The cocoa of Guatemala is wonderful, but the growers, who have great native knowledge, also need to learn new methods so they can transform their chocolate into the kind of high-quality product expected in European markets, with the help of AGEXPORT,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the UVG Altiplano campus, Mayan instructor Jeremías Morales, who runs the maker space, trained with Amy Smith, an MIT senior lecturer and founding director of the D-Lab, to facilitate creative capacity-building programs. He is working with nearby villages on a solution for the backbreaking labor of planting broccoli seedlings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here in Guatemala, small farm holders don’t have technology to do this task,” says Solano. Through design and prototyping workshops, the village and UVG professors have developed an inexpensive device that accomplishes this painful work. “After their next iteration of this technology, we can support the participants in starting a business,” says Solano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to invent solutions to commonplace but vexing problems keep popping up. A small village of 100 families has to share two mills to grind corn for their tortillas. It’s a major household expense. With ASPIRE facilitators, a group of women designed a prototype corn mill for home use. “They were skeptical at first, especially when their initial prototypes didn’t work,” reports Solano, “but when they finally succeeded, there was so much excitement about the results, an energy and happiness that you could feel in the room.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopting an MIT mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feeling of empowerment, a pillar of sustainable development, has great meaning for UVG Professor Victor Hugo Ayerdi, an ASPIRE project manager and director of UVG’s Department of Mechanical Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In college and after I graduated, I thought since everything came from developed countries, and I was in a developing country, I couldn’t invent products.” With that mindset, he says, he went to work in manufacturing and sales for an international tire manufacturing company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when he arrived at UVG in 2009, Ayerdi heard from mechanical engineering students who craved practical experience designing and building things. Determined to create maker spaces for the three UVG campuses, he took a field trip to MIT, whose motto is “mens et manus” or “mind and hand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The trip changed my life,” he says. “The MIT mindset is to believe in yourself, try things, and fail, but assume there has to be a way to do it.”&amp;nbsp;As a result, he says, he realized UVG faculty and students could also use scientific and engineering knowledge to invent products, become entrepreneurs, spark economic growth; they had the capacity. He and other UVG colleagues were primed for change when the ASPIRE opportunity emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As some ASPIRE research projects wind down their initial phases, others are just gearing up, including an effort to fashion a water purification system from the shells of farmed shrimp. “We are only just starting to get results from our research,” says Stein. “But we are totally betting on the ASPIRE model because it works at MIT and other places.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASPIRE researchers acknowledge they are looking at long timelines to make significant inroads against environmental, health, educational, and economic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My greatest hope is that ASPIRE will have planted the seed of this innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem model, and that in a decade, UVG will have optimized the different programs, whether in training, entrepreneurship, or research, enough to actively transfer them to other Central American universities,” says Stein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to be the hub of this network and we want to stay connected, because, in theory, we can work together on problems that we have in common in our region.

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As Earth’s temperature rises, agricultural practices will need to adapt. Droughts will likely become more frequent, and some land may no longer be arable. On top of that is the challenge of feeding an ever-growing population without expanding the production of fertilizer and other agrochemicals, which have a large carbon footprint that is contributing to the overall warming of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers across MIT are taking on these agricultural challenges from a variety of angles, from engineering plants that sound an alarm when they’re under stress to making seeds more resilient to drought. These types of technologies, and more yet to be devised, will be essential to feed the world’s population as the climate changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After water, the first thing we need is food. In terms of priority, there is water, food, and then everything else. As we are trying to find new strategies to support a world of 10 billion people, it will require us to invent new ways of making food,” says Benedetto Marelli, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marelli is the director of one of the six missions of the recently launched&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://climateproject.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Climate Project at MIT&lt;/a&gt;, which focus on research areas such as decarbonizing industry and building resilient cities. Marelli directs the Wild Cards mission, which aims to identify unconventional solutions that are high-risk and high-reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on expertise from a breadth of fields, MIT is well-positioned to tackle the challenges posed by climate change, Marelli says. “Bringing together our strengths across disciplines, including engineering, processing at scale, biological engineering, and infrastructure engineering, along with humanities, science, and economics, presents a great opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting seeds from drought&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marelli, who began his career as a biomedical engineer working on regenerative medicine, is now developing ways to boost crop yields by helping seeds to survive and germinate during drought conditions, or in soil that has been depleted of nutrients. To achieve that, he has devised&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/seeds-drought-coating-0708" target="_blank"&gt;seed coatings&lt;/a&gt;, based on silk and other polymers, that can envelop and nourish seeds during the critical germination process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/seeds-drought-coating-0708"&gt;&lt;img class="image" src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-Drought-Seeds-01-press_0.jpg" data-align="center" alt="germinating seeds in special coating" width="899" height="600" data-caption="&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://news.mit.edu/2021/seeds-drought-coating-0708&amp;quot;&amp;gt;A new seed-coating process could facilitate agriculture on marginal arid lands by enabling the seeds to retain any available water.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy soil, plants have access to nitrogen, phosphates, and other nutrients that they need, many of which are supplied by microbes that live in the soil. However, in soil that has suffered from drought or overfarming, these nutrients are lacking. Marelli’s idea was to coat the seeds with a polymer that can be embedded with plant-growth-promoting bacteria that “fix” nitrogen by absorbing it from the air and making it available to plants. The microbes can also make other necessary nutrients available to plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first generation of the seed coatings, he embedded these microbes in coatings made of silk — a material that he had previously shown can extend the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-based-startup-cambridge-crops-wraps-food-in-silk-0605" target="_blank"&gt;shelf life&lt;/a&gt; of produce, meat, and other foods.&amp;nbsp;In his lab at MIT, Marelli has shown that the seed coatings can help germinating plants survive drought, ultraviolet light exposure, and high salinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, working with researchers at the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco, he is adapting the approach to crops native to Morocco, a country that has experienced six consecutive years of drought due a drop in rainfall linked to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these studies, the researchers are using a biopolymer coating derived from food waste that can be easily obtained in Morocco, instead of silk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re working with local communities to extract the biopolymers, to try to have a process that works at scale so that we make materials that work in that specific environment.” Marelli says. “We may come up with an idea here at MIT within a high-resource environment, but then to work there, we need to talk with the local communities, with local stakeholders, and use their own ingenuity and try to match our solution with something that could actually be applied in the local environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbes as fertilizers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether they are experiencing drought or not, crops grow much better when synthetic fertilizers are applied. Although it’s essential to most farms,&amp;nbsp;applying fertilizer is expensive and has environmental consequences. Most of the world’s fertilizer is produced using the Haber-Bosch process, which converts nitrogen and hydrogen to ammonia at high temperatures and pressures. This energy intensive process accounts for about 1.5 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, and the transportation required to deliver it to farms around the world adds even more emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ariel Furst, the Paul M. Cook Career Development Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT,&amp;nbsp;is developing a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/microbes-could-reduce-need-for-chemical-fertilizers-1115" target="_blank"&gt;microbial alternative&lt;/a&gt; to the Haber-Bosch process. Some farms have experimented with applying nitrogen-fixing bacteria directly to the roots of their crops, which has shown some success. However, the microbes are too delicate to be stored long-term or shipped anywhere, so they must be produced in a bioreactor on the farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/microbes-could-reduce-need-for-chemical-fertilizers-1115"&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-Microbial-Fertilizer-01-press_0.jpg" data-align="center" data-entity-uuid="15d5b2f9-5bc8-4399-9bf9-1b12eb92f299" data-entity-type="file" alt="Illustration of a thriving plant and its roots in the ground that are surrounded by microbes. Two insets are shown: At left, a larger version of a blue microbe with white triangular formations. To the left of that, a larger version of one of those formations reveals a lattice made from molecular components." width="899" height="600" data-caption="&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://news.mit.edu/2023/microbes-could-reduce-need-for-chemical-fertilizers-1115&amp;quot;&amp;gt;MIT chemical engineers devised a metal-organic coating that protects bacterial cells from damage without impeding their growth or function.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome those challenges, Furst has developed a way to coat the microbes with a protective shell that prevents them from being destroyed by heat or other stresses. The coating also protects microbes from damage caused by freeze-drying — a process that would make them easier to transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coatings can vary in composition, but they all consist of two components. One is a metal such as iron, manganese, or zinc, and the other is a polyphenol — a type of plant-derived organic compound that includes tannins and other antioxidants. These two components self-assemble into a protective shell that encapsulates bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These microbes would be delivered with the seeds, so it would remove the need for fertilizing mid-growing. It also reduces the cost and provides more autonomy to the farmers and decreases carbon emissions associated with agriculture,” Furst says.&amp;nbsp;“We think it’ll be a way to make agriculture completely regenerative, so to bring back soil health while also boosting crop yields and the nutrient density of the crops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furst has founded a company called Seia Bio, which is working on commercializing the coated microbes and has begun testing them on farms in Brazil. In her lab, Furst is also working on adapting the approach to coat microbes that can capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into limestone, which helps to raise the soil pH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can help change the pH of soil to stabilize it, while also being a way to effectively perform direct air capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,” she says. “Right now, farmers may truck in limestone to change the pH of soil, and so you’re creating a lot of emissions to bring something in that microbes can do on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distress sensors for plants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Michael Strano, the Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT, began to explore the idea of using plants themselves as sensors that could reveal when they’re in distress. When plants experience drought, attack by pests, or other kinds of stress, they produce hormones and other signaling molecules to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strano, whose lab specializes in developing tiny sensors for a variety of molecules, wondered if such sensors could be deployed inside plants to pick up those distress signals. To create their sensors, Strano’s lab takes advantage of the special properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes, which emit fluorescent light. By wrapping the tubes with different types of polymers, the sensors can be tuned to detect specific targets, giving off a fluorescent signal when the target is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For use in plants, Strano and his colleagues&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/plant-sensors-could-be-early-warning-system-farmers-0417" target="_blank"&gt;created sensors&lt;/a&gt; that could detect signaling molecules such as salicylic acid and hydrogen peroxide. They then showed that these sensors could be inserted into the underside of plant leaves, without harming the plants. Once embedded in the mesophyll of the leaves, the sensors can pick up a variety of signals, which can be read with an infrared camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/plant-sensors-could-be-early-warning-system-farmers-0417"&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-Plant-Sensor-01-press_0.jpg" data-entity-uuid="eddfb897-1745-4953-8a39-c8cb77c0986d" data-entity-type="file" alt="Illustration of bok choy has, on left, leaves being attacked by aphids, and on right, leaves burned by the sun’s heat. Two word balloons show the plant is responding with alarm: “!!!”" width="900" height="600" data-caption="&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://news.mit.edu/2024/plant-sensors-could-be-early-warning-system-farmers-0417&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Sensors that detect plant signaling molecules can reveal when crops are experiencing too much light or heat, or attack from insects or microbes.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sensors can reveal, in real-time, whether a plant is experiencing a variety of stresses. Until now, there hasn’t been a way to get that information fast enough for farmers to act on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’re trying to do is make tools that get information into the hands of farmers very quickly, fast enough for them to make adaptive decisions that can increase yield,” Strano says.&amp;nbsp;“We’re in the middle of a revolution of really understanding the way in which plants internally communicate and communicate with other plants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of sensing could be deployed in fields, where it could help farmers respond more quickly to drought and other stresses, or in greenhouses, vertical farms, and other types of indoor farms that use technology to grow crops in a controlled environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Strano’s work in this area has been conducted with the support of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and as part of the Disruptive and Sustainable Technologies for Agricultural Precision (DiSTAP) program at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), and sensors have been deployed in tests in crops at a controlled environment farm in Singapore called Growy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The same basic kinds of tools can help detect problems in open field agriculture or in controlled environment agriculture,” Strano says. “They both suffer from the same problem, which is that the farmers get information too late to prevent yield loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing pesticide use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pesticides represent another huge financial expense for farmers: Worldwide, farmers spend about $60 billion per year on pesticides. Much of this pesticide ends up accumulating in water and soil, where it can harm many species, including humans. But, without using pesticides, farmers may lose more than half of their crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kripa Varanasi, an MIT professor of mechanical engineering, is working on tools that can help farmers measure how much pesticide is reaching their plants, as well as technologies that can help pesticides adhere to plants more efficiently, reducing the amount that runs off into soil and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varanasi, whose research focuses on interactions between liquid droplets and surfaces, began to think about applying his work to agriculture more than a decade ago, after attending a conference at the USDA. There, he was inspired to begin developing ways to improve the efficiency of pesticide application by optimizing the interactions that occur at leaf surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Billions of drops of pesticide are being sprayed on every acre of crop, and only a small fraction is ultimately reaching and staying on target. This seemed to me like a problem that we could help to solve,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varanasi and his students began exploring strategies to make drops of pesticide stick to leaves better, instead of bouncing off. They&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/reducing-runoff-pollution-making-spray-droplets-less-bouncy-0830" target="_blank"&gt;found that&lt;/a&gt; if they added polymers with positive and negative charges, the oppositely charged droplets would form a hydrophilic (water-attracting) coating on the leaf surface, which helps the next droplets applied to stick to the leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/reducing-pesticide-use-while-increasing-effectiveness-agzen-0312"&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/default/files/images/inline/MIT-New-KripaV-image.jpg" data-align="center" data-entity-uuid="e4a0518c-85a7-4d71-ae76-0db8350112a9" data-entity-type="file" alt="A farm vehicle uses a long arm to spray many crops. Inset on left shows an iPad with an app showing “coverage history” and speed as “good.” On left, another inset shows leaves, and the sprayed chemical shows up as bright blue." width="900" height="600" data-caption="&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://news.mit.edu/2024/reducing-pesticide-use-while-increasing-effectiveness-agzen-0312&amp;quot;&amp;gt;AgZen has developed a system for farming that can monitor exactly how much of the sprayed chemicals adheres to plants, in real time, as the sprayer drives through a field.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, they developed an easier-to-use technology in which a surfactant is added to the pesticide before spraying. When this mixture is sprayed through a special nozzle, it forms tiny droplets that are “cloaked” in surfactant. The surfactant helps the droplets to stick to the leaves within a few milliseconds, without bouncing off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Varanasi and Vishnu Jayaprakash SM ’19, PhD ’22 founded a company called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/reducing-pesticide-use-while-increasing-effectiveness-agzen-0312" target="_blank"&gt;AgZen&lt;/a&gt; to commercialize their technologies and get them into the hands of farmers. They incorporated their ideas for improving pesticide adhesion into a product called EnhanceCoverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the testing for this product, they realized that there weren’t any good ways to measure how many of the droplets were staying on the plant. That led them to develop a product known as RealCoverage, which is based on machine vision. It can be attached to any pesticide sprayer and offer real-time feedback on what percentage of the pesticide droplets are sticking to and staying on every leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RealCoverage was used on 65,000 acres of farmland across the United States in 2024, from soybeans in Iowa to cotton in Georgia. Farmers who used the product were able to reduce their pesticide use by 30 to 50 percent, by using the data to optimize delivery and, in some cases, even change what chemicals were sprayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hopes that the EnhanceCoverage product, which is expected to become available in 2025, will help farmers further reduce their pesticide use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our mission here is to help farmers with savings while helping them achieve better yields. We have found a way to do all this while also reducing waste and the amount of chemicals that we put into our atmosphere and into our soils and into our water,” Varanasi says. “This is the MIT approach: to figure out what are the real issues and how to come up with solutions. Now we have a tool and I hope that it’s deployed everywhere and everyone gets the benefit from it.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-36cd180c-7fff-24cc-d4d7-86d852deb591"&gt;In a first for both universities, MIT undergraduates are engaged in research projects at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (UVG), while MIT scholars are collaborating with UVG undergraduates on in-depth field studies in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-36cd180c-7fff-24cc-d4d7-86d852deb591"&gt;These pilot projects are part of a larger enterprise, called ASPIRE (Achieving Sustainable Partnerships for Innovation, Research, and Entrepreneurship). Funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, this five-year, $15-million initiative brings together MIT, UVG, and the Guatemalan Exporters Association to promote sustainable solutions to local development challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This research is yielding insights into our understanding of how to design with and for marginalized people, specifically Indigenous people,” says Elizabeth Hoffecker, co-principal investigator of ASPIRE at MIT and director of the MIT Local Innovation Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The students’ work is bearing fruit in the form of publications and new products — directly advancing ASPIRE’s goals to create an innovation ecosystem in Guatemala that can be replicated elsewhere in Central and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For the students, the project offers rewards both tangible and inspirational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My experience allowed me to find my interest in local innovation and entrepreneurship,” says Ximena Sarmiento García, a fifth-year undergraduate at UVG majoring in anthropology. Supervised by Hoffecker, Sarmiento García says, “I learned how to inform myself, investigate, and find solutions — to become a researcher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sandra Youssef, a rising junior in mechanical engineering at MIT, collaborated with UVG researchers and Indigenous farmers to design a mobile cart to improve the harvest yield of snow peas. “It was perfect for me,” she says. “My goal was to use creative, new technologies and science to make a dent in difficult problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote and effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Kendra Leith, co-principal investigator of ASPIRE, and associate director for research at MIT D-Lab, shaped the MIT-based undergraduate research opportunities (UROPs) in concert with UVG colleagues. “Although MIT students aren’t currently permitted to travel to Guatemala,&amp;nbsp;I wanted them to have an opportunity to apply their experience and knowledge to address real-world challenges,” says Leith. “The Covid pandemic prepared them and their counterparts at UVG for effective remote collaboration — the UROPs completed remarkably productive research projects over Zoom and met our goals for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT students participated in some of UVG’s most ambitious ASPIRE research. For instance, Sydney Baller, a rising sophomore in mechanical engineering, joined a team of Indigenous farmers and UVG mechanical engineers investigating the manufacturing process and potential markets for essential oils extracted from thyme, rosemary, and chamomile plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Indigenous people have thousands of years working with plant extracts and ancient remedies,” says Baller. “There is promising history there that would be important to follow up with more modern research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sandra Youssef used computer-aided design and manufacturing to realize a design created in a hackathon by snow pea farmers. “Our cart had to hold 495 pounds of snow peas without collapsing or overturning, navigate narrow paths on hills, and be simple and inexpensive to assemble,” she says. The snow pea producers have tested two of Youssef’s designs, built by a team at UVG led by Rony Herrarte, a faculty member in the department of mechanical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From waste to filter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Two MIT undergraduates joined one of UVG’s long-standing projects: addressing pollution in Guatemala’s water. The research seeks to use chitosan molecules, extracted from shrimp shells, for bioremediation of heavy metals and other water contaminants. These shells are available in abundance, left as waste by the country’s shrimp industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Sophomores Ariana Hodlewsky, majoring in chemical engineering, and Paolo Mangiafico, majoring in brain and cognitive sciences, signed on to work with principal investigator and chemistry department instructor Allan Vásquez (UVG) on filtration systems utilizing chitosan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The team wants to find a cost-effective product rural communities, most at risk from polluted water, can use in homes or in town water systems,” says Mangiafico. “So we have been investigating different technologies for water filtration, and analyzing the Guatemalan and U.S. markets to understand the regulations and opportunities that might affect introduction of a chitosan-based product.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Our research into how different communities use water and into potential consumers and pitfalls sets the scene for prototypes UVG wants to produce,” says Hodlewsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lourdes Figueroa, UVG ASPIRE project manager for technology transfer, found their assistance invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Paolo and Ariana brought the MIT culture and mindset to the project,” she says. “They wanted to understand not only how the technology works, but the best ways of getting the technology out of the lab to make it useful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This was an “Aha!” moment, says Figueroa. “The MIT students made a major contribution to both the engineering and marketing sides by emphasizing that you have to think about how to guarantee the market acceptance of the technology while it is still under development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;UVG’s three campuses have served as incubators for problem-solving innovation and entrepreneurship, in many cases driven by students from Indigenous communities and families. In 2022, Elizabeth Hoffecker, with eight UVG anthropology majors, set out to identify the most vibrant examples of these collaborative initiatives, which ASPIRE seeks to promote and replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hoffecker’s “innovation ecosystem diagnostic” revealed a cluster of activity centered on UVG’s Altiplano campus in the central highlands, which serves Mayan communities. Hoffecker and two of the anthropology students focused on four examples for a series of case studies, which they&amp;nbsp;are currently preparing for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The caliber of their work was so good that it became clear to me that we could collaborate on a paper,” says Hoffecker. “It was my first time publishing with undergraduates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers’ cases included novel production of traditional thread, and creation of a 3D phytoplankton kit&amp;nbsp;that is being used to educate community members about water pollution in Lake Atitlán, a tourist destination that drives the local economy but is increasingly being affected by toxic algae blooms. Hoffecker singles out a project by Indigenous undergraduates who developed play-based teaching tools for introducing basic mathematical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“These connect to local Mayan ways of understanding and offer a novel, hands-on way to strengthen the math teaching skills of local primary school teachers in Indigenous communities,” says Hoffecker. “They created something that addresses a very immediate need in the community — lack of training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Both of Hoffecker’s undergraduate collaborators are writing theses&amp;nbsp;inspired by&amp;nbsp;these case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My time with Elizabeth allowed me to learn how to conduct research from scratch, ask for help, find solutions, and trust myself,” says Sarmiento García. She finds the ASPIRE approach profoundly appealing. “It is not only ethical, but also deeply committed to applying results to the real lives of the people involved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This experience has been incredibly positive, validating my own ability to generate knowledge through research, rather than relying only on established authors to back up my arguments,” says Camila del Cid, a fifth-year anthropology student. “This was empowering, especially as a Latin American researcher, because it emphasized that my perspective and contributions are important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Hoffecker says this pilot run with UVG undergrads produced “high-quality research that can inform evidence-based decision-making on development issues of top regional priority” — a key goal for ASPIRE. Hoffecker plans to “develop a pathway that other UVG students can follow to conduct similar research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT undergraduate research will continue. “Our students’ activities have been very valuable in Guatemala, so much so that the snow pea, chitosan, and essential oils teams would like to continue working with our students this year,” says Leith.&amp;nbsp; She anticipates a new round of MIT UROPs for next summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Youssef, for one, is eager to get to work on refining the snow pea cart. “I like the idea of working outside my comfort zone, thinking about things that seem unsolvable and coming up with a solution to fix some aspect of the problem,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to connect a certain amount of average global warming with one’s everyday experience, so researchers at MIT have devised a different approach to quantifying the direct impact of climate change. Instead of focusing on global averages, they came up with the concept of “outdoor days”: the number days per year in a given location when the temperature is not too hot or cold to enjoy normal outdoor activities, such as going for a walk, playing sports, working in the garden, or dining outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/new-way-quantify-climate-change-impacts-outdoor-days-0322"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year, the researchers applied this method to compare the impact of global climate change on different countries around the world, showing that much of the global south would suffer major losses in the number of outdoor days, while some northern countries could see a slight increase. Now, they have applied the same approach to comparing the outcomes for different parts of the United States, dividing the country into nine climatic regions, and finding similar results: Some states, especially Florida and other parts of the Southeast, should see a significant drop in outdoor days, while some, especially in the Northwest, should see a slight increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at correlations between economic activity, such as tourism trends, and changing climate conditions, and examined how numbers of outdoor days could result in significant social and economic impacts. Florida’s economy, for example, is highly dependent on tourism and on people moving there for its pleasant climate; a major drop in days when it is comfortable to spend time outdoors could make the state less of a draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings were &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL111607"&gt;published this month in the journal &lt;em&gt;Geophysical Research Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in a paper by researchers Yeon-Woo Choi and Muhammad Khalifa and professor of civil and environmental engineering Elfatih Eltahir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is something very new in our attempt to understand impacts of climate change impact, in addition to the changing extremes,” Choi says. It allows people to see how these global changes may impact them on a very personal level, as opposed to focusing on global temperature changes or on extreme events such as powerful hurricanes or increased wildfires. “To the best of my knowledge, nobody else takes this same approach” in quantifying the local impacts of climate change, he says. “I hope that many others will parallel our approach to better understand how climate may affect our daily lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at two different climate scenarios — one where maximum efforts are made to curb global emissions of greenhouse gases and one “worst case” scenario where little is done and global warming continues to accelerate. They used these two scenarios with every available global climate model, 32 in all, and the results were broadly consistent across all 32 models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality may lie somewhere in between the two extremes that were modeled, Eltahir suggests. “I don’t think we’re going to act as aggressively” as the low-emissions scenarios suggest, he says, “and we may not be as careless” as the high-emissions scenario. “Maybe the reality will emerge in the middle, toward the end of the century,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked at the difference in temperatures and other conditions over various ranges of decades. The data already showed some slight differences in outdoor days from the 1961-1990 period compared to 1991-2020. The researchers then compared these most recent 30 years with the last 30 years of this century, as projected by the models, and found much greater differences ahead for some regions. The strongest effects in the modeling were seen in the Southeastern states. “It seems like climate change is going to have a significant impact on the Southeast in terms of reducing the number of outdoor days,” Eltahir says, “with implications for the quality of life of the population, and also for the attractiveness of tourism and for people who want to retire there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that “surprisingly, one of the regions that would benefit a little bit is the Northwest.” But the gain there is modest: an increase of about 14 percent in outdoor days projected for the last three decades of this century, compared to the period from 1976 to 2005. The Southwestern U.S., by comparison, faces an average loss of 23 percent of their outdoor days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also digs into the relationship between climate and economic activity by looking at tourism trends from U.S. National Park Service visitation data, and how that aligned with differences in climate conditions. “Accounting for seasonal variations, we find a clear connection between the number of outdoor days and the number of tourist visits in the United States,” Choi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of the country, there will be little overall change in the total number of annual outdoor days, the study found, but the seasonal pattern of those days could change significantly. While most parts of the country now see the most outdoor days in summertime, that will shift as summers get hotter, and spring and fall will become the preferred seasons for outdoor activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, Eltahir says, “what we are talking about that will happen in the future [for most of the country] is already happening in Florida.” There, he says, “the really enjoyable time of year is in the spring and fall, and summer is not the best time of year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People’s level of comfort with temperatures varies somewhat among individuals and among regions, so the researchers designed a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://eltahir.mit.edu/globaloutdoordays/"&gt;tool&lt;/a&gt;, now freely available online, that allows people to set their own definitions of the lowest and highest temperatures they consider suitable for outdoor activities, and then see what the climate models predict would be the change in the number of outdoor days for their location, using their own standards of comfort. For their study, they used a widely accepted range of 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) to 25 C (77 F), which is the “thermoneutral zone” in which the human body does not require either metabolic heat generation or evaporative cooling to maintain its core temperature — in other words, in that range there is generally no need to either shiver or sweat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model mainly focuses on temperature but also allows people to include humidity or precipitation in their definition of what constitutes a comfortable outdoor day. The model could be extended to incorporate other variables such as air quality, but the researchers say temperature tends to be the major determinant of comfort for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using their software tool, “If you disagree with how we define an outdoor day, you could define one for yourself, and then you’ll see what the impacts of that are on your number of outdoor days and their seasonality,” Eltahir says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was inspired by the realization, he says, that “people’s understanding of climate change is based on the assumption that climate change is something that’s going to happen sometime in the future and going to happen to someone else. It’s not going to impact them directly. And I think that contributes to the fact that we are not doing enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the concept of outdoor days “brings the concept of climate change home, brings it to personal everyday activities,” he says. “I hope that people will find that useful to bridge that gap, and provide a better understanding and appreciation of the problem. And hopefully that would help lead to sound policies that are based on science, regarding climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was based on work supported by the Community Jameel for Jameel Observatory CREWSnet and Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>The changing geography of “energy poverty”</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Study of the U.S. shows homes in the South and Southwest could use more aid for energy costs, due to a growing need for air conditioning in a warming climate.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A growing portion of Americans who are struggling to pay for their household energy live in the South and Southwest, reflecting a climate-driven shift away from heating needs and toward air conditioning use, an MIT study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly published research also reveals that a major U.S. federal program that provides energy subsidies to households, by assigning block grants to states, does not yet fully match these recent trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work evaluates the “energy burden” on households, which reflects the percentage of income needed to pay for energy necessities, from 2015 to 2020. Households with an energy burden greater than 6 percent of income are considered to be in “energy poverty.” With climate change, rising temperatures are expected to add financial stress in the South, where air conditioning is increasingly needed. Meanwhile, milder winters are expected to reduce heating costs in some colder regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From 2015 to 2020, there is an increase in burden generally, and you do also see this southern shift,” says Christopher Knittel, an MIT energy economist and co-author of a new paper detailing the study’s results. About federal aid, he adds, “When you compare the distribution of the energy burden to where the money is going, it’s not aligned too well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adp8183" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. federal resource allocations are inconsistent with concentrations of energy poverty&lt;/a&gt;,” is published today in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are Carlos Batlle, a professor at Comillas University in Spain and a senior lecturer with the MIT Energy Initiative; Peter Heller SM ’24, a recent graduate of the MIT Technology and Policy Program; Knittel, the George P. Shultz Professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and associate dean for climate and sustainability at MIT; and Tim Schittekatte, a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A scorching decade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which grew out of graduate research that Heller conducted at MIT, deploys a machine-learning estimation technique that the scholars applied to U.S. energy use data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the researchers took a sample of about 20,000 households from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey, which includes a wide variety of demographic characteristics about residents, along with building-type and geographic information. Then, using the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey data for 2015 and 2020, the research team estimated the average household energy burden for every census tract in the lower 48 states — 73,057 in 2015, and 84,414 in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That allowed the researchers to chart the changes in energy burden in recent years, including the shift toward a greater energy burden in southern states. In 2015, Maine, Mississippi, Arkansas, Vermont, and Alabama were the five states (ranked in descending order) with the highest energy burden across census bureau tracts. In 2020, that had shifted somewhat, with Maine and Vermont dropping on the list and southern states increasingly having a larger energy burden. That year, the top five states in descending order were Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, West Virginia, and Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also reflect a urban-rural shift. In 2015, 23 percent of the census tracts where the average household is living in energy poverty were urban. That figure&amp;nbsp;shrank to 14 percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, the data are consistent with the picture of a warming world, in which milder winters in the North, Northwest, and Mountain West require less heating fuel, while more extreme summer temperatures in the South require more air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Who’s going to be harmed most from climate change?” asks Knittel. “In the U.S., not surprisingly, it’s going to be the southern part of the U.S. And our study is confirming that, but also suggesting it’s the southern part of the U.S that’s least able to respond. If you’re already burdened, the burden’s growing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An evolution for LIHEAP?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to identifying the shift in energy needs during the last decade, the study also illuminates a longer-term change in U.S. household energy needs, dating back to the 1980s. The researchers compared the present-day geography of U.S. energy burden to the help currently provided by the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which dates to 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal aid for energy needs actually predates LIHEAP, but the current program was introduced in 1981, then updated in 1984 to include cooling needs such as air conditioning. When the formula was updated in 1984, two “hold harmless” clauses were also adopted, guaranteeing states a minimum amount of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, LIHEAP’s parameters also predate the rise of temperatures over the last 40 years, and the current study shows that, compared to the current landscape of energy poverty, LIHEAP distributes relatively less of its funding to southern and southwestern states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way Congress uses formulas set in the 1980s keeps funding distributions nearly the same as it was in the 1980s,” Heller observes. “Our paper illustrates the shift in need that has occurred over the decades since then.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, it would take a fourfold increase in LIHEAP to ensure that no U.S. household experiences energy poverty. But the researchers tested out a new funding design, which would help the worst-off households first, nationally, ensuring that no household would have an energy burden of greater than 20.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that’s probably the most equitable way to allocate the money, and by doing that, you now have a different amount of money that should go to each state, so that no one state is worse off than the others,” Knittel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the new distribution concept would require a certain amount of subsidy reallocation among states, it would be with the goal of helping all households avoid a certain level of energy poverty, across the country, at a time of changing climate, warming weather, and shifting energy needs in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can optimize where we spend the money, and that optimization approach is an important thing to think about,” Knittel says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT’s innovation and entrepreneurship system helps launch water, food, and ag startups with social and economic benefits.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inventive solutions to some of the world’s most critical problems are being discovered in labs, classrooms, and centers across MIT every day. Many of these solutions move from the lab to the commercial world with the help of over 85 Institute resources that comprise MIT’s robust innovation and entrepreneurship (I&amp;amp;E) ecosystem. The Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) draws on MIT’s wealth of I&amp;amp;E knowledge and experience to help researchers commercialize their breakthrough technologies through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/SolutionsGrants"&gt;J-WAFS Solutions grant program&lt;/a&gt;. By collaborating with I&amp;amp;E programs on campus, J-WAFS prepares MIT researchers for the commercial world, where their novel innovations aim to improve productivity, accessibility, and sustainability of water and food systems, creating economic, environmental, and societal benefits along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J-WAFS Solutions program launched in 2015 with support from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.communityjameel.org/"&gt;Community Jameel&lt;/a&gt;, an international organization that advances science and learning for communities to thrive. Since 2015, J-WAFS Solutions has supported 19 projects with one-year grants of up to $150,000, with some projects receiving renewal grants for a second year of support. Solutions projects all address challenges related to water or food. Modeled after the esteemed grant program of MIT’s Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, and initially administered by Deshpande Center staff, the J-WAFS Solutions program follows a similar approach by supporting projects that have already completed the basic research and proof-of-concept phases.&amp;nbsp;With technologies that are one to three years away from commercialization, grantees work on identifying their potential markets and learn to focus on how their technology can meet the needs of future customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ingenuity thrives at MIT, driving inventions that can be translated into real-world applications for widespread adoption, implantation, and use,” says J-WAFS Director Professor John H. Lienhard V. “But successful commercialization of MIT technology requires engineers to focus on many challenges beyond making the technology work. MIT’s I&amp;amp;E network offers a variety of programs that help researchers develop technology readiness, investigate markets, conduct customer discovery, and initiate product design and development,” Lienhard adds.&amp;nbsp;“With this strong I&amp;amp;E framework, many J-WAFS Solutions teams have established startup companies by the completion of the grant.&amp;nbsp;J-WAFS-supported technologies have had powerful, positive effects on human welfare. Together, the J-WAFS Solutions program and MIT’s I&amp;amp;E ecosystem demonstrate how academic research can evolve into business innovations that make a better world,” Lienhard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating I&amp;amp;E collaborations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to support for furthering research, J-WAFS Solutions grants allow faculty, students, postdocs, and research staff to learn the fundamentals of how to transform their work into commercial products and companies. As part of the grant requirements, researchers must interact with mentors through MIT Venture Mentoring Service (VMS). VMS connects MIT entrepreneurs with teams of carefully selected professionals who provide free and confidential mentorship, guidance, and other services to help advance ideas into for-profit, for-benefit, or nonprofit ventures. Since 2000, VMS has mentored over 4,600 MIT entrepreneurs across all industries, through a dynamic and accomplished group of nearly 200 mentors who volunteer their time so that others may succeed. The mentors provide impartial and unbiased advice to members of the MIT community, including MIT alumni in the Boston area. J-WAFS Solutions teams have been guided by 21 mentors from numerous companies and nonprofits. Mentors often attend project events and progress meetings throughout the grant period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working with VMS has provided me and my organization with a valuable sounding board for a range of topics, big and small,” says Eric Verploegen PhD ’08, former research engineer in the MIT D-Lab and founder of J-WAFS spinout &lt;a href="https://www.coolveg.org/"&gt;CoolVeg&lt;/a&gt;. Along with professors Leon Glicksman and Daniel Frey, Verploegen received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2021 to commercialize cold-storage chambers that use evaporative cooling to help farmers preserve fruits and vegetables in rural off-grid communities. Verploegen started CoolVeg in 2022 to increase access and adoption of open-source, evaporative cooling technologies through collaborations with businesses, research institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and government agencies. “Working as a solo founder at my nonprofit venture, it is always great to have avenues to get feedback on communications approaches, overall strategy, and operational issues that my mentors have experience with,” Verploegen says. Three years after the initial Solutions grant, one of the VMS mentors assigned to the evaporative cooling team still acts as a mentor to Verploegen today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Solutions grant requirement is for teams to participate in the Spark program — a free, three-week course that provides an entry point for researchers to explore the potential value of their innovation. Spark is part of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which is an “immersive, entrepreneurial training program that facilitates the transformation of invention to impact.” In 2018, MIT received an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-selected-ninth-nsf-innovation-corps-node-new-england-0904"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; from the NSF, establishing the New England Regional Innovation Corps Node (NE I-Corps) to deliver I-Corps training to participants across New England. Trainings are open to researchers, engineers, scientists, and others who want to engage in a customer discovery process for their technology. Offered regularly throughout the year, the Spark course helps participants identify markets and explore customer needs in order to understand how their technologies can be positioned competitively in their target markets. They learn to assess barriers to adoption, as well as potential regulatory issues or other challenges to commercialization. NE-I-Corps reports that since its start, over 1,200 researchers from MIT have completed the program and have gone on to launch 175 ventures, raising over $3.3 billion in funding from grants and investors, and creating over 1,800 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantinos Katsimpouras, a research scientist in the Department of Chemical Engineering, went through the NE I-Corps Spark program to better understand the customer base for a technology he developed with&amp;nbsp;professors Gregory Stephanopoulos and Anthony Sinskey.&amp;nbsp;The group received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2021&amp;nbsp;for their microbial platform that converts food waste from the dairy industry into valuable products.&amp;nbsp;“As a scientist with no prior experience in entrepreneurship, the program introduced me to important concepts and tools for conducting customer interviews and adopting a new mindset,” notes Katsimpouras. “Most importantly, it encouraged me to get out of the building and engage in interviews with potential customers and stakeholders, providing me with invaluable insights and a deeper understanding of my industry,” he adds. These interviews also helped connect the team with companies willing to provide resources to test and improve their technology — a critical step to the scale-up of any lab invention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Professor Cem Tasan’s research group in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, the I-Corps program led them to the J-WAFS Solutions grant, instead of the other way around. Tasan is currently working with postdoc Onur Guvenc on a J-WAFS Solutions project to manufacture formable sheet metal by consolidating steel scrap without melting, thereby reducing water use compared to traditional steel processing. Before applying for the Solutions grant, Guvenc took part in NE I-Corps. Like Katsimpouras, Guvenc benefited from the interaction with industry. “This program required me to step out of the lab and engage with potential customers, allowing me to learn about their immediate challenges and test my initial assumptions about the market,” Guvenc recalls. “My interviews with industry professionals also made me aware of the connection between water consumption and steelmaking processes, which ultimately led to the J-WAFS 2023 Solutions Grant,” says Guvenc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the Spark program, participants may be eligible to apply for the Fusion program, which provides microgrants of up to $1,500 to conduct further customer discovery. The Fusion program is self-paced, requiring teams to conduct 12 additional customer interviews and craft a final presentation summarizing their key learnings. Professor Patrick Doyle’s J-WAFS Solutions team completed the Spark and Fusion programs at MIT. Most recently, their team was accepted to join the NSF I-Corps National program with a $50,000 award. The intensive program requires teams to complete an additional 100 customer discovery interviews over seven weeks. Located in the Department of Chemical Engineering, the Doyle lab is working on a sustainable microparticle hydrogel system to rapidly remove micropollutants from water. The team’s focus has expanded to higher value purifications in amino acid and biopharmaceutical manufacturing applications. Devashish Gokhale PhD ’24 worked with Doyle on much of the underlying science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our platform technology could potentially be used for selective separations in very diverse market segments, ranging from individual consumers to large industries and government bodies with varied use-cases,” Gokhale explains. He goes on to say, “The I-Corps Spark program added significant value by providing me with an effective framework to approach this problem ... I was assigned a mentor who provided critical feedback, teaching me how to formulate effective questions and identify promising opportunities.” Gokhale says that by the end of Spark, the team was able to identify the best target markets for their products. He also says that the program provided valuable seminars on topics like intellectual property, which was helpful in subsequent discussions the team had with MIT’s Technology Licensing Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another member of Doyle’s team, Arjav Shah, a recent PhD from MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering and a current MBA candidate at the MIT Sloan School of Management, is spearheading the team’s commercialization plans. Shah attended Fusion last fall and hopes to lead efforts to incorporate a startup company called hydroGel.&amp;nbsp; “I admire the hypothesis-driven approach of the I-Corps program,” says Shah. “It has enabled us to identify our customers’ biggest pain points, which will hopefully lead us to finding a product-market fit.” He adds “based on our learnings from the program, we have been able to pivot to impact-driven, higher-value applications in the food processing and biopharmaceutical industries.” Postdoc Luca Mazzaferro will lead the technical team at hydroGel alongside Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a different project, Qinmin Zheng, a postdoc in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, is working with Professor Andrew Whittle and Lecturer Fábio Duarte. Zheng plans to take the Fusion course this fall to advance their J-WAFS Solutions project that aims to commercialize a novel sensor to quantify the relative abundance of major algal species and provide early detection of harmful algal blooms. After completing Spark, Zheng says he’s “excited to participate in the Fusion program, and potentially the National I-Corps program, to further explore market opportunities and minimize risks in our future product development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic and societal benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercializing technologies developed at MIT is one of the ways J-WAFS helps ensure that MIT research advances will have real-world impacts in water and food systems. Since its inception, the J-WAFS Solutions program has awarded 28 grants (including renewals), which have supported 19 projects that address a wide range of global water and food challenges. The program has distributed over $4 million to 24 professors, 11 research staff, 15 postdocs, and 30 students across MIT. Nearly half of all J-WAFS Solutions projects have resulted in spinout companies or commercialized products, including eight companies to date plus two open-source technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nona-technologies.com/"&gt;Nona Technologies&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a J-WAFS spinout that is helping the world by developing new approaches to produce freshwater for drinking. Desalination — the process of removing salts from seawater — typically requires a large-scale technology called reverse osmosis. But Nona created a desalination device that can work in remote off-grid locations.&amp;nbsp;By separating salt and bacteria from water using electric current through a process called ion concentration polarization (ICP), their technology also reduces overall energy consumption. The novel method was developed by Jongyoon Han, professor of electrical engineering and biological engineering, and research scientist Junghyo Yoon. Along with Bruce Crawford, a Sloan MBA alum, Han and Yoon created Nona Technologies to bring their lightweight, energy-efficient desalination technology to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My feeling early on was that once you have technology, commercialization will take care of itself,” admits Crawford. The team completed both the Spark and Fusion programs and quickly realized that much more work would be required. “Even in our first 24 interviews, we learned that the two first markets we envisioned would not be viable in the near term, and we also got our first hints at the beachhead we ultimately selected,” says Crawford. Nona Technologies has since won MIT’s $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, received media attention from outlets like &lt;em&gt;Newsweek &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, and hired a team that continues to further the technology for deployment in resource-limited areas where clean drinking water may be scarce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-borne diseases sicken millions of people worldwide each year, but J-WAFS researchers are addressing this issue by integrating molecular engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence to revolutionize food pathogen testing. Professors Tim Swager and Alexander Klibanov, of the Department of Chemistry, were awarded one of the first J-WAFS Solutions grants for their sensor that targets food safety pathogens. The sensor uses specialized droplets that behave like a dynamic lens, changing in the presence of target bacteria in order to detect dangerous bacterial contamination in food. In 2018, Swager launched &lt;a href="https://www.xibus.systems/"&gt;Xibus Systems Inc.&lt;/a&gt; to bring the sensor to market and advance food safety for greater public health, sustainability, and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our involvement with the J-WAFS Solutions Program has been vital,” says Swager. “It has provided us with a bridge between the academic world and the business world and allowed us to perform more detailed work to create a usable application,” he adds. In 2022, Xibus developed a product called XiSafe, which enables the detection of contaminants like salmonella and listeria faster and with higher sensitivity than other food testing products. The innovation could save food processors billions of dollars worldwide and prevent thousands of food-borne fatalities annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS Solutions companies have raised nearly $66 million in venture capital and other funding. Just this past June, J-WAFS spinout SiTration announced that it raised an $11.8 million seed round. Jeffrey Grossman, a professor in MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, was another early J-WAFS Solutions grantee for his work on low-cost energy-efficient filters for desalination. The project enabled the development of nanoporous membranes and resulted in two spinout companies, &lt;a href="https://viaseparations.com/"&gt;Via Separations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sitration.com/"&gt;SiTration&lt;/a&gt;. SiTration was co-founded by Brendan Smith PhD ’18, who was a part of the original J-WAFS team. Smith is CEO of the company and has overseen the advancement of the membrane technology, which has gone on to reduce cost and resource consumption in industrial wastewater treatment, advanced manufacturing, and resource extraction of materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel from recycled electric vehicle batteries. The company also recently announced that it is working with the mining company Rio Tinto to handle harmful wastewater generated at mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not just J-WAFS spinout companies that are producing real-world results. Products like the ECC Vial — a portable, low-cost method for &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; detection in water — have been brought to the market and helped thousands of people. The test kit was developed by MIT D-Lab Lecturer Susan Murcott and Professor Jeffrey Ravel of the MIT History Section. The duo received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2018 to promote safely managed drinking water and improved public health in Nepal, where it is difficult to identify which wells are contaminated by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. By the end of their grant period, the team had manufactured approximately 3,200 units, of which 2,350 were distributed — enough to help 12,000 people in Nepal. The researchers also trained local Nepalese on best manufacturing practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important, in my life experience, to follow your dream and to serve others,” says Murcott. Economic success is important to the health of any venture, whether it’s a company or a product, but equally important is the social impact — a philosophy that J-WAFS research strives to uphold. “Do something because it’s worth doing and because it changes people’s lives and saves lives,” Murcott adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS prepares to celebrate its 10th anniversary this year, we look forward to continued collaboration with MIT’s many I&amp;amp;E programs to advance knowledge and develop solutions that will have tangible effects on the world’s water and food systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/SolutionsGrants"&gt;J-WAFS Solutions program&lt;/a&gt; and about &lt;a href="https://facts.mit.edu/entrepreneurship-innovation/"&gt;innovation and entrepreneurship at MIT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;People around the globe often depend on informal financial arrangements, borrowing and lending money through social networks. Understanding this sheds light on local economies and helps fight poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a study co-authored by an MIT economist illuminates a striking case of informal finance: In East Africa, money moves in very different patterns depending on whether local societies are structured around family units or age-based groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, while much of the world uses the extended family as a basic social unit, hundreds of millions of people live in societies with stronger age-based cohorts. In these cases, people are initiated into adulthood together and maintain closer social ties with each other than with extended family. That affects their finances, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found there are major impacts in that social structure really does matter for how people form financial ties,” says Jacob Moscona, an MIT economist and co-author of a newly published paper detailing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “In age-based societies when someone gets a cash transfer, the money flows in a big way to other members of their age cohort but not to other [younger or older] members of an extended family. And you see the exact opposite pattern in kin-based groups, where money is transferred within the family but not the age cohort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads to measurable health effects. In kin-based societies, grandparents often share their pension payments with grandchildren. In Uganda, the study reveals, an additional year of pension payments to a senior citizen in a kin-based society reduces the likelihood of child malnourishment by 5.5 percent, compared to an age-based society where payments are less likely to move across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20211856" target="_blank"&gt;Age Set versus Kin: Culture and Financial Ties in East Africa&lt;/a&gt;,” is published in the September issue of the &lt;em&gt;American Economic Review&lt;/em&gt;. The authors are Moscona, the 3M Career Development Assistant Professor of Economics in MIT’s Department of Economics; and Awa Ambra Seck, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying informal financial arrangements has long been an important research domain for economists. MIT Professor Robert Townsend, for one, helped advance this area of scholarship with innovative studies of finances in rural Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the specific matter of analyzing how age-based social groups function, in comparison to the more common kin-based groups, has tended to be addressed more by anthropologists than economists. Among the Maasai people in Northern Kenya, for example, anthropologists have observed that age-group friends have closer ties to each other than anyone apart from a spouse and children. Maasai age-group cohorts frequently share food and lodging, and more extensively than they do even with siblings. The current study adds economic data points to this body of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct the research, the scholars first analyzed the Kenyan government’s Hunger Safety Net Program (HSNP), a cash transfer project initiated in 2009 covering 48 locations in Northern Kenya. The program included both age-based and kin-based social groups, allowing for a comparison of its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In age-based societies, the study shows, there was a spillover in spending by HSNP recipients on others in the age cohort, with zero additional cash flows to those in other generations; in kin-based societies, they also found a spillover across generations, but without informal cash flows otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Uganda, where both kin-based and age-based societies exist, the researchers studied the national roll-out of the Senior Citizen Grant (SCG) program, initiated in 2011, which consists of a monthly cash transfer to seniors of about $7.50, equivalent to roughly 20 percent of per-capita spending. Similar programs exist or are being rolled out across sub-Saharan Africa, including in regions where age-based organization is common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here again, the researchers found financial flows aligned to kin-based and age-based social ties. In particular, they show&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;the pension program had large positive effects on child nutrition in kin-based households, where ties across generations are strong; the team found zero evidence of these effects in age-based societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These policies had vastly different effects on these two groups, on account of the very different structure of financial ties,” Moscona says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Moscona, there are at least two large reasons to evaluate the variation between these financial flows: understanding society more thoroughly and rethinking how to design social programs in these circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s telling us something about how the world works, that social structure is really important for shaping these [financial] relationships,” Moscona says. “But it also has a big potential impact on policy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, if a social policy is designed to help limit childhood poverty, or senior poverty, experts will want to know how the informal flow of cash in a society interacts with it. The current study shows that understanding social structure should be a high-order concern for making policies more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these two ways of organizing society, different people are on average more vulnerable,” Moscona says. “In the kin-based groups, because the young and the old share with each other, you don’t see as much inequality across generations. But in age-based groups, the young and the old are left systematically more vulnerable. And in kin-based groups, some entire families are doing much worse than others,&amp;nbsp;while in age-based societies the age sets often cut across lineages or extended families, making them more equal. That’s worth considering if you’re thinking about poverty reduction.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT startup AeroShield has opened a new facility for manufacturing highly insulating windows that will reduce building energy use and cut carbon emissions.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imagine if the windows of your home didn’t transmit heat. They’d keep the heat indoors in winter and outdoors on a hot summer’s day. Your heating and cooling bills would go down; your energy consumption and carbon emissions would drop; and you’d still be comfortable all year ’round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aeroshield.tech/" target="_blank"&gt;AeroShield&lt;/a&gt;, a startup spun out of MIT, is poised to start manufacturing such windows. Building operations make up 36 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, and today’s windows are a major contributor to energy inefficiency in buildings. To improve building efficiency, AeroShield has developed a window technology that promises to reduce heat loss by up to 65 percent, significantly reducing energy use and carbon emissions in buildings, and the company just announced the opening of a new facility to manufacture its breakthrough energy-efficient windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our mission is to decarbonize the built environment,” says Elise Strobach SM ’17, PhD ’20, co-founder and CEO of AeroShield. “The availability of affordable, thermally insulating windows will help us achieve that goal while also reducing homeowner’s heating and cooling bills.” According to the U.S. Department of Energy, for most homeowners, 30 percent of that bill results from window inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology development at MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on AeroShield’s window technology began a decade ago in the MIT lab of Evelyn Wang, Ford Professor of Engineering, now on leave to serve as director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). In late 2014, the MIT team received funding from ARPA-E, and other sponsors followed, including the MIT Energy Initiative through the MIT Tata Center for Technology and Design in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work focused on aerogels, remarkable materials that are ultra-porous, lighter than a marshmallow, strong enough to support a brick, and an unparalleled barrier to heat flow. Aerogels were invented in the 1930s and used by NASA and others as thermal insulation. The team at MIT saw the potential for incorporating aerogel sheets into windows to keep heat from escaping or entering buildings. But there was one problem: Nobody had been able to make aerogels transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An aerogel is made of transparent, loosely connected nanoscale silica particles and is 95 percent air. But an aerogel sheet isn’t transparent because light traveling through it gets scattered by the silica particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five years of theoretical and experimental work, the MIT team determined that the key to transparency was having the silica particles both small and uniform in size. This allows light to pass directly through, so the aerogel becomes transparent. Indeed, as long as the particle size is small and uniform, increasing the thickness of an aerogel sheet to achieve greater thermal insulation won’t make it less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams in the MIT lab looked at various applications for their super-insulating, transparent aerogels. Some focused on improving solar thermal collectors by making the systems more efficient and less expensive. But to Strobach, increasing the thermal efficiency of windows looked especially promising and potentially significant as a means of reducing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers determined that aerogel sheets could be inserted into the gap in double-pane windows, making them more than twice as insulating. The windows could then be manufactured on existing production lines with minor changes, and the resulting windows would be affordable and as wide-ranging in style as the window options available today. Best of all, once purchased and installed, the windows would reduce electricity bills, energy use, and carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact on energy use in buildings could be considerable. “If we only consider winter, windows in the United States lose enough energy to power over 50 million homes,” says Strobach. “That wasted energy generates about 350 million tons of carbon dioxide — more than is emitted by 76 million cars.” Super-insulating windows could help home and building owners reduce carbon dioxide emissions by gigatons while saving billions in heating and cooling costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The AeroShield story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Strobach and her MIT colleagues — Aaron Baskerville-Bridges MBA ’20, SM ’20 and Kyle Wilke PhD ’19 — co-founded AeroShield to further develop and commercialize their aerogel-based technology for windows and other applications. And in the subsequent five years, their hard work has attracted attention, recently leading to two major accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spring 2024, the company announced the opening of its new pilot manufacturing facility in Waltham, Massachusetts, where the team will be producing, testing, and certifying their first full-size windows and patio doors for initial product launch. The 12,000 square foot facility will significantly expand the company’s capabilities, with cutting-edge aerogel R&amp;amp;D labs, manufacturing equipment, assembly lines, and testing equipment. Says Strobach, “Our pilot facility will supply window and door manufacturers as we launch our first products and will also serve as our R&amp;amp;D headquarters as we develop the next generation of energy-efficient products using transparent aerogels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in spring 2024, AeroShield received a $14.5 million award from ARPA-E’s “Seeding Critical Advances for Leading Energy technologies with Untapped Potential” (SCALEUP) program, which provides new funding to previous ARPA-E awardees that have “demonstrated a viable path to market.” That funding will enable the company to expand its production capacity to tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of units per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strobach also cites two less-obvious benefits of the SCALEUP award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the funding is enabling the company to move more quickly on the scale-up phase of their technology development. “We know from our fundamental studies and lab experiments that we can make large-area aerogel sheets that could go in an entry or patio door,” says Elise. "The SCALEUP award allows us to go straight for that vision. We don’t have to do all the incremental sizes of aerogels to prove that we can make a big one. The award provides capital for us to buy the big equipment to make the big aerogel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the SCALEUP award confirms the viability of the company to other potential investors and collaborators. Indeed, AeroShield recently announced $5 million of additional funding from existing investors Massachusetts Clean Energy Center and MassVentures, as well as new investor MassMutual Ventures. Strobach notes that the company now has investor, engineering, and customer partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She stresses the importance of partners in achieving AeroShield’s mission. “We know that what we’ve got from a fundamental perspective can change the industry,” she says. “Now we want to go out and do it. With the right partners and at the right pace, we may actually be able to increase the energy efficiency of our buildings early enough to help make a real dent in climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;How do you measure the value of an economic policy? Of an aid organization’s programming? For Saeed Miganeh, who completed an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/" target="_blank"&gt;MITx&amp;nbsp;MicroMasters in Data, Economics, and Development Policy&lt;/a&gt; and is now enrolled in MIT’s&amp;nbsp;master’s program in &lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/academic-programs/masters-programs/masters-data-economics-and-design-policy-dedp" target="_blank"&gt;Data, Economics, and Design of Policy&lt;/a&gt; (DEDP), these are key questions he is determined to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Enrolling at MIT fed my interest in investigating the political economy questions surrounding the development of African countries,” he says. “It boils down to promoting pro-poor, evidence-based policymaking in the developing world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Miganeh earned a bachelor of business administration from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.uoh-edu.net/"&gt;University of Hargeisa&lt;/a&gt; and completed coursework in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.oum.edu.my/"&gt;Open University Malaysia’s&lt;/a&gt; master of business administration program. Before enrolling at MIT full time, he spent 14 years as an accountant with the United Nations’&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.iom.int/"&gt;International Organization for Migration&lt;/a&gt;. His work with the IOM fed his curiosity about intent and impact, particularly how political agendas can affect policy adoption, how safeguarding human rights strengthens peace and prevents conflict, how climate change adaptation policies affect the poor, and how promoting intra-African trade spurs economic growth in the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My journey to DEDP began when I earned a certificate in Monitoring and Evaluation offered by the International Training Center of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.itcilo.org/"&gt;International Labour Organization&lt;/a&gt;,” he recalls. “Our course coach recommended taking MITx courses, which led me to the MicroMasters program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Saeed grew up and completed his early education in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland during the reconstruction period after a decade-long civil war with Somalia. He was inspired by his country’s development of a functioning democracy and economy after conflict. Miganeh’s work is all the more impressive for someone who has lived almost exclusively there — with the exception of four years as a child spent in Ethiopia due to the civil war in Somalia — and whose studies have taken place entirely in the republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Africa is the new battleground for fighting global poverty in the 21st century,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practices and progress toward measurable improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before pursuing graduate study at MIT, Miganeh worked in youth development programs with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://sonyo.org/"&gt;Somaliland National Youth Organization&lt;/a&gt;. “I was the coordinator for one of their youth networks that worked on health,” he says. “After completing my undergraduate study, I assumed the position of finance officer for the organization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Later during his tenure with IOM, Miganeh learned that, while the organization has a central evaluation function that evaluates projects and programs, Somaliland’s governmental institutions lacked the capacity to effectively evaluate public policies and programs effectively. His work with the IOM helped him discover the practice areas where he might benefit from partnering with others possessing expertise he’d need to make a difference. “During my work with IOM, I was involved in development projects’ administrative and accounting functions,” he remembers. “I was interested in knowing how projects were impacting beneficiaries’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Miganeh wants to dig deeper into understanding and answering developing African countries’ political economy questions, noting that “development projects can consume lots of resources from design through implementation.” Ensuring these programs’ effectiveness is crucial to maximizing their impact and societal benefit. “Every country needs to have the necessary human capital to undertake evidence-based policy design to avoid wasting resources,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He returned to Somaliland to complete a capstone project that will allow him to put his newly acquired skills and knowledge to work. The project is an important part of his master’s program. “I’m [working] with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://moe.govsomaliland.org/"&gt;Somaliland Ministry of Education &amp;amp; Science&lt;/a&gt;, assisting in institutionalizing evidence-based policymaking in the education sector,”&amp;nbsp; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A unique vision to drive effective change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Miganeh is already planning to use the skills he’s acquiring at MIT to facilitate change at home. “I must discover and produce policy insights using my research and, with the guidance of the top academics and professionals at MIT and other institutions, translate them into effective policies that can make a demonstrable impact,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Miganeh reports that MITx’s MicroMasters and DEDP master’s programs help students develop the unique blend of skills — including the ability to leverage data-driven insights to design, implement, and evaluate public policies that improve societal outcomes — that can help them become effective agents of social change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My early enthusiasm for mathematics in high school and my later work in development organizations gave me the right combination to excel in the rigorous developmental economics coursework at MIT,” he says. “Once I’ve completed the program, I will establish a consultancy to advise government agencies, nonprofits, and the private sector’s corporate social responsibility departments on designing, implementing, and evaluating policies and programs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Miganeh lauded the faculty and students he encountered while continuing his studies. “I have developed professionally and personally,” he reports. He saved his highest praise for the Institute, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Pursuing this master’s degree at MIT, where modern economics education has been reinvented and is home to faculty including Nobel laureates and other distinguished professors and scholars, was an enriching lifetime experience, personally and professionally,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Looking back on discussions of how to tackle the world’s development challenges is a memory that will stay with me for the rest of my life.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT D-Lab students and instructors are improving the efficacy and economics of a brooder technology for newborn chicks that utilizes a practical, local resource: beeswax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed through participatory design with agricultural partners in Cameroon, their Off-Grid Brooder is a solution aimed at improving the profitability of the African nation’s small- and medium-scale poultry farms. Since it is common for smallholders in places with poor electricity supply to tend open fires overnight to keep chicks warm, the invention might also let farmers catch up on their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The target is eight hours. If farmers can sustain the warmth for eight hours, then they get to sleep,” says D-Lab instructor and former student Ahmad (Zak) Zakka SM ’23, who traveled to Cameroon in May to work on implementing brooder improvements tested at the D-Lab, along with D-Lab students, collaborators from African Solar Generation (ASG), and the African Diaspora Council of Switzerland – Branch Cameroon (CDAS–BC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poultry farming is heavily concentrated in lower- and middle-income countries, where it is an important component of rural economies and provides an inexpensive source of protein for residents. Raising chickens is fraught with economic risk, however, largely because it is hard for small-scale farmers to keep newborn chicks warm enough to survive (33 to 35 degrees Celsius, or 91 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on age). After the cost of feed, firewood used to heat the chick space is the biggest input for rural poultry farmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to D-Lab researchers, an average smallholder in Cameroon using traditional brooding methods spends $17 per month on firewood, achieves a 10 percent profit margin, and experiences chick mortality that can be as high as a total loss due to overheating or insufficient heat. The Off-Grid Brooder is designed to replace open fires with inexpensive, renewable, and locally available beeswax — a phase-change material used to make thermal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASG initially developed a brooder technology, the SolarBox, that used photovoltaic panels and electric batteries to power incandescent bulbs. While this provided effective heating, it was prohibitively expensive and difficult to maintain. In 2020, students from the D-Lab Energy class took on the challenge of reducing the cost and complexity of the SolarBox heating system to make it more accessible to small farmers in Cameroon. Through participatory design — a collaborative approach that involves all stakeholders in early stages of the design process — the team discovered a unique solution. Beeswax stored in a used glass container (such as a mayonnaise jar) is melted using a double boiler over a fire and then installed inside insulated brooder boxes alongside the chicks. As the beeswax cools and solidifies, it releases heat for several hours, keeping the brooder within the temperature range that chicks need to grow and develop. Farmers can then recharge the cooled wax batteries and repeat the process again and again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The big challenge was how to get heat,” says D-Lab Research Scientist Daniel Sweeney, who, with Zakka, co-teaches two D-Lab classes, 2.651/EC.711 (Introduction to Energy in Global Development), and 2.652/EC.712 (Applications of Energy in Global Development). “Decoupling the heat supplied by biomass (wood) from the heat the chicks need at night in the brooder, that’s the core of the innovation here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D-Lab instructors, researchers, and students have tested and tuned the system with partners in Cameroon. A research box constructed during a D-Lab trip to Cameroon in January 2023 worked well, but was “very expensive to build,” Zakka says. “The research box was a proof of concept in the field. The next step was to figure out how to make it affordable,” he continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new brooder box, made entirely of locally sourced recycled materials at 5 percent of the cost of the research prototype, was developed during D-Lab’s January 2024 trip to Cameroon. Designed and produced in collaboration with CDAS-BC, the new brooder is much more affordable, but its functionality still needs fine-tuning. From late-May through mid-June, the D-Lab team, led by Zakka, worked with Cameroonian collaborators to improve the system again. This time, they assessed the efficacy of using straw, a readily available and low-cost material, arranged in panels to insulate the brooder box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team was hosted by CDAS-BC, including its president and founder Carole Erlemann Mengue and secretary and treasurer Kathrin Witschi, who operate an organic poultry farm in Afambassi, Cameroon. “The students will experiment with the box and try to improve the insulation of the box without neglecting that the chicks will need ventilation,” they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the CDAS-BC partners say that they hoped to explore increasing the number of chicks that the box can keep warm. “If the system could heat 500 to 1,000 chicks at a time,” they note, “it would help farmers save firewood, to sleep through the night, and to minimize the risk of fire in the building and the risk of stepping on chicks while replacing firewood.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this spring, Erlemann Mengue and Witschi tested the low-cost Off-Grid Brooder Box, which can hold 30 to 40 chicks in its current design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were very interested in partnering with us to evaluate the technology. They are running the tests and doing a lot of technical measurement to track the temperature inside the brooder over time,” says Sweeney, adding that the CDAS-BC partners are amassing datasets that they send to the MIT D-Lab team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney and Zakka, along with PhD candidate Aly Kombargi, who worked on the research box in Cameroon last year, hope to not only improve the functionality of the Off-Grid Poultry Brooder but also broaden its use beyond Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal of our trip was to have a working prototype, and the goal since then has been to scale this up,” Kombargi says. “It’s absolutely scalable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concurring that “the technology should work across developing countries in small-scale poultry sectors,” Zakka says this spring’s D-Lab trip included workshops for area poultry farmers to teach them about benefits of the Off-Grid Brooder and how to make their own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m excited to see if we can get people excited about pushing this as a business … to see if they would build and sell it to other people in the community,” Zakka says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adds Sweeney, “This isn’t rocket science. If we have some guidance and some open-source information we could share, I’m pretty sure (farmers) could put them together on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, he says, partners identified through MIT’s networks in Zambia and Uganda are building their own brooders based on the D-Lab design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS), which supports research, innovation, and cross-disciplinary collaborations involving water and food systems, awarded the Off-Grid Brooder project a $25,000 research and development grant in 2022. The program is “pleased that the project’s approach was grounded in engagement with MIT students and community collaborators,” says Executive Director Renee J. Robins ’83. “The participatory design process helped produce innovative prototypes that are already making positive impacts for smallholder poultry farmers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That process and the very real impact on communities in Cameroon is what draws students to the project and keeps them committed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney says a recent D-Lab design review for the chick brooder highlighted that the project continued to attract the attention and curiosity of students who participated in earlier stages and still want to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s something about this project. There’s this whole tribe of students that are still active on the broader project,” he says. “There’s something about it.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/na"&gt;J-PAL North America&lt;/a&gt;, a regional office of MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), will significantly expand its work to conduct rigorous research and strengthen evidence-based policymaking due to a new grant from long-time supporter and collaborator&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.arnoldventures.org/"&gt;Arnold Ventures&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With Arnold Ventures’ new eight-figure grant over seven years, J-PAL North America aims to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;substantially expand the evidence base on effective solutions to poverty;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;build the capacity and increase the diversity of its network of over 265 expert researchers;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;institutionalize the use of evidence among nonprofits and policymakers; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;accelerate the rate and scale at which evidence influences policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Furthermore, J-PAL North America will leverage these funds to deepen its work centering racial and economic equity across our research network, the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/laying-foundation-diversify-economics-field-and-center-racial-equity-economics-research-0511"&gt;field of economics&lt;/a&gt;, and social policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“J-PAL’s mission is to reduce poverty by ensuring that policy is informed by scientific evidence. We recognize that poverty is a pressing and complex issue, so we work to identify and scale solutions across various sectors, including education, health, and labor. This support from Arnold Ventures will take our work to the next level, creating new pathways for generating evidence, informing policy, and impacting lives,” says J-PAL North America Co-Executive Director Vincent Quan. “We are thrilled about this groundbreaking, expanded collaboration with Arnold Ventures on strengthening the evidence-informed ecosystem as we enter J-PAL North America’s second decade.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A long-standing collaboration for evidence-based solutions&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This new work builds on a long-standing foundation of successful collaboration&amp;nbsp;between J-PAL North America and Arnold Ventures, who together have raised the bar for rigorous social science research and evidence-based policymaking.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The research center recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary, having&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/north-america-at-10"&gt;reached over 35 million lives&lt;/a&gt; by scaling evidence-based programs that have been rigorously evaluated by J-PAL affiliated researchers. J-PAL North America has worked with Arnold Ventures, along with other collaborators, to catalyze over&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/blog/9-11-23/reflecting-decade-impactful-research-j-pal-north-america"&gt;165 rigorous evaluations&lt;/a&gt; on topics ranging from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/publication/promises-summer-youth-employment-programs-lessons-randomized-evaluations"&gt;summer youth employment programs&lt;/a&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/impact-poverty-reduction-among-new-mothers-child-brain-development-united-states"&gt;cash transfers&lt;/a&gt;. Arnold Ventures’ support for J-PAL North America’s research has helped shift over $518 million toward effective solutions to reduce poverty. For example, informed by J-PAL evidence, federal and state education agencies across the United States earmarked Covid-relief funds for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/tutoring-accelerate-learning"&gt;tutoring to help accelerate learning&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the pandemic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Justin Milner, executive vice president of evidence and evaluation at Arnold Ventures, explains that “Arnold Ventures is proud to have worked alongside J-PAL North America over the past decade, raising the bar for rigorous research and evidence-based policymaking. We’re excited to deepen our partnership to further institutionalize a culture of evidence among decision-makers and increase our collective impact in the years to come.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“J-PAL North America’s economic innovations and policy accomplishments directly advance SHASS’ mission of meeting the world’s great challenges. We are therefore eager for J-PAL North America to continue its essential work with Arnold Ventures, and look forward to seeing the impact of their collaboration on the larger MIT community and — most notably — the people in this region for years to come,” says Agustín Rayo, dean of MIT’s School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An urgent need for evidence-based solutions to address poverty&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Poverty remains a pervasive challenge in the North America region. In 2022, the official poverty rate in the United States was 11.5 percent, equating to nearly 38 million people living below the poverty line. The need to identify and scale effective solutions is paramount. J-PAL North America is excited to continue working with Arnold Ventures to build on the growing evidence-based policymaking movement, generate critical new research, and foster lasting policy partnerships to address some of society's greatest challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Amy Finkelstein, J-PAL North America’s co-scientific director, says, “When J-PAL North America was founded, Arnold Ventures saw our potential to transform the meaning of impact evaluation in the region. Now, a decade later, we’re proud to further solidify our collaboration and build on the foundations we have created together. I am incredibly excited that this grant will enable us to further expand the knowledge base of effective solutions to poverty and to better support the scale-up of these solutions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What if testing for Lyme disease were as simple as dropping a tick in a test tube at home, waiting a few minutes, and looking for a change of color?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT Sloan Fellow and physician's assistant Erin Dawicki is making it happen, as part of her aspiration to make Lyme testing accessible, affordable, and widespread. She noticed a troubling increase in undetected Lyme disease in her practice and collaborated with fellow MIT students to found&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://lymealert.com/meet-our-team/"&gt;Lyme&amp;nbsp;Alert&lt;/a&gt;, a startup that has created the first truly at-home Lyme screening kit using nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme Alert focuses on social impact in its mission to deliver faster diagnoses while using its technology to track disease spread. Participating in the 2024&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://pkgcenter.mit.edu/programs/ideas/"&gt;IDEAS Social Innovation Challenge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;(IDEAS) helped the team refine their solution while keeping impact at the heart of their work. They ultimately won the top prize at the program’s award ceremony in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 23 years, IDEAS has fostered a community in which hundreds of entrepreneurial students have developed their innovation skills in collaboration with affected stakeholders, experienced entrepreneurs, and a supportive network of alumni, classmates, and mentors. The 14 teams in the 2024 IDEAS cohort join over 200 alumni teams — many still in operation today — that have received over $1.5 million in seed funding since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“IDEAS is a great example of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://elo.mit.edu/"&gt;experiential learning at MIT&lt;/a&gt;: empowering students to ask good questions, explore new frameworks, and propose sustainable interventions to urgent challenges alongside community partners," says Lauren Tyger, assistant dean of social innovation at the &lt;a href="https://pkgcenter.mit.edu/"&gt;Priscilla King Gray Public Service Center&lt;/a&gt; (PKG Center) at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As MIT’s premier social impact incubator housed within the&amp;nbsp;PKG Center, IDEAS prepares students to take their early-stage ideas to the next level. Teams learn how to develop relationships with constituents affected by social issues, propose interventions that yield measurable impact, and create effective social enterprise models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This program undoubtedly opened my eyes to the intersection of social impact and entrepreneurship, fields I previously thought to be mutually exclusive,” says Srihitha Dasari, a rising&amp;nbsp;junior in brain and cognitive sciences and co-founder of another award-winning team,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/pkg-ideas-2024/solutions/87011"&gt;PuntoSalud&lt;/a&gt;. “It not only provided me with vital skills to advance my own interests in the startup ecosystem, but expanded my network in order to enact change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaping the “leaders of tomorrow”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of one semester, IDEAS teams participate in iterative workshops, refine their ideas with mentors, and pitch their solutions to peers and judges. The process helps students transform their concepts into social innovations in health care, finance, climate, education, and many more fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program culminates in an awards ceremony at the MIT Museum, where teams share their final products. This year’s showcase featured a keynote address from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/christine-ortiz/"&gt;Christine Ortiz&lt;/a&gt;, professor of materials science and engineering. Her passion for socially-directed science and technology aligns with IDEAS’ focus on social impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was grateful to be a part of the journey for these 14 teams,” Ortiz says. “IDEAS speaks to the core of what MIT needs: innovators capable of thinking critically about problems within their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five teams are selected for awards of&amp;nbsp;$6,000 to $20,000 by a group of experts across a variety of industries who volunteer as judges, and two additional award grants of $2,500 are given to teams that received the most votes through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Solve&lt;/a&gt; initiative’s IDEAS virtual showcase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams that received awards this year are:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/pkg-ideas-2024/solutions/87026"&gt;Lyme Alert&lt;/a&gt;, which created the first truly at-home tick testing kit for Lyme disease; &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/pkg-ideas-2024/solutions/87012"&gt;My Sister’s Keeper&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to establish a professional leadership incubator designed specifically for Muslim immigrant women in the United States; &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/pkg-ideas-2024/solutions/87014"&gt;Sakhi - Simppl&lt;/a&gt;, which created a WhatsApp chatbot that generates responses grounded in accurate, verified knowledge from international health agencies; &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/pkg-ideas-2024/solutions/87022"&gt;BendShelters&lt;/a&gt;, which provides sustainable, modular, and easily deployable bamboo shelters for displaced populations in Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country under a dictatorship; &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/pkg-ideas-2024/solutions/87011"&gt;PuntoSalud&lt;/a&gt;, an AI-powered virtual health messaging system that delivers personalized, trustworthy information sourced directly from local hospitals in Argentina; &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/pkg-ideas-2024/solutions/86960"&gt;ONE Community&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a digital network through which businesses in India at risk of displacement can connect with more customers and partners to ensure sustained and resilient growth; and &lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/pkg-ideas-2024/solutions/87017"&gt;Mudzi Cooking Project&lt;/a&gt;, a social enterprise tackling the challenges faced by women in Chisinga, Malawi, who struggle to access firewood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a member of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://sciencehub.mit.edu/about/"&gt;Science Hub&lt;/a&gt;, the PKG Center worked with corporate partner Amazon, which sponsored the top five awards for the first time in 2024. The inaugural Amazon Prizes for Social Good honored the teams’ efforts to use tech to solve social issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, these students are inspired to give rather than to take, and their work distinguishes them all as the leaders of tomorrow,” says Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of&amp;nbsp;the teams will refine their ideas over the summer and report back by the start of the next academic year. Additionally, for a period of 16 months the teams that won awards will continue to receive guidance from the PKG Center and a founder support network with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-pkg-ideas-social-innovation-challenge-0612"&gt;2023 group of IDEAS grantees&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tapping MIT’s innovation ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDEAS is just one of the PKG Center’s programs that provide opportunities for students to focus on social impact. In tandem with other&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://mit.edu/innovation/"&gt;Institute resources for student innovators&lt;/a&gt;, PKG enables students to apply their innovation skills to solve real-world problems while supporting community-informed solutions to systemic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The PKG Center is a valued partner in enabling the growing numbers of students who aspire to create impact-focused ventures,” says Don Shobrys, director of MIT Venture Mentoring Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to make those ventures successful, Tyger explains, “IDEAS teaches students frameworks to deeply understand the systems around a challenge, get to know who’s already addressing it, find gaps, and then design and implement something that will uniquely and sustainably address the challenge. Rather than optimizing for profit alone, IDEAS helps students learn how to optimize for what can produce the most social good or reduce the most harm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyger notes that although IDEAS’ emphasis on social impact is somewhat unique, it is complemented by MIT’s rich entrepreneurship ecosystem. “There are many resources and people who are incredibly generous with their time — and who above all do it because they know we are all supporting the growth of students,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s program collaborators included&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://sandbox.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sandbox.mit.edu/dhive" target="_blank"&gt;MIT D-Hive&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/start/entrepreneurship/startup-incubator/"&gt;Arts Startup Incubator&lt;/a&gt;, which co-hosted informational sessions for applicants in the fall;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/bu-law-clinic/"&gt;BU Law Clinic&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/"&gt;D-Lab&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://systemsawareness.mit.edu/"&gt;Systems-Awareness Lab&lt;/a&gt; leaders, who served as guest speakers throughout the spring;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://vms.mit.edu/"&gt;Venture Mentoring Service&lt;/a&gt;, which matched teams with mentors; entrepreneurs-in-residence from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/"&gt;Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;, who judged final pitches and advised teams;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://designx.mit.edu/"&gt;DesignX&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;the Center for Development and Entrepreneurship at MIT (formerly the &lt;a href="https://legatum.mit.edu/"&gt;Legatum Center)&lt;/a&gt;, which provided additional support to several teams;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Solve&lt;/a&gt;, which hosted the teams on their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/pkg-ideas-2024/solutions#challenge-subnav-offset"&gt;voting platform&lt;/a&gt;; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ihq.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Innovation HQ&lt;/a&gt;, which provided space for students to meet one another and exchange ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While IDEAS projects are designed to be a means of transformative change for public good, many students say that the program is transformative for them, as well. “Before IDEAS, I didn’t see myself as an innovator — just someone passionate about solving a problem that I’d heard people facing across diseases,” reflects Anika Wadhera, a rising senior in biological engineering and co-founder of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://solve.mit.edu/challenges/pkg-ideas-2024/solutions/87018"&gt;Chronolog Health&lt;/a&gt;, a platform revolutionizing chronic illness management. “Now I feel much more confident in my ability to actually make a difference by better understanding the different stakeholders and the factors that are necessary to make a transformative solution.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT spinout SiTration looks to disrupt industries with a revolutionary process for recovering and extracting critical materials.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The next time you cook pasta, imagine that you are cooking spaghetti, rigatoni, and seven other varieties all together, and they need to be separated onto 10 different plates before serving. A colander can remove the water — but you still have a mound of unsorted noodles.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now imagine that this had to be done for thousands of tons of pasta a day. That gives you an idea of the scale of the problem facing Brendan Smith PhD ’18, co-founder and CEO of SiTration, a startup formed out of MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE) in 2020.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;SiTration, which raised $11.8 million in seed capital led by venture capital firm 2150 earlier this month, is revolutionizing the extraction and refining of copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium, precious metals, and other materials critical to manufacturing clean-energy technologies such as electric motors, wind turbines, and batteries. Its initial target applications are recovering the materials from complex mining feed streams, spent lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles, and various metals refining processes.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The company’s breakthrough lies in a new silicon membrane technology that can be adjusted to efficiently recover disparate materials, providing a more sustainable and economically viable alternative to conventional, chemically intensive processes. Think of a colander with adjustable pores to strain different types of pasta. SiTration’s technology has garnered interest from industry players, including mining giant Rio Tinto.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Some observers may question whether targeting such different industries could cause the company to lose focus. “But when you dig into these markets, you discover there is actually a significant overlap in how all of these materials are recovered, making it possible for a single solution to have impact across verticals,” Smith says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powering up materials recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional methods of extracting critical materials in mining, refining, and recycling lithium-ion batteries involve heavy use of chemicals and heat, which harm the environment. Typically, raw ore from mines or spent batteries are ground into fine particles before being dissolved in acid or incinerated in a furnace. Afterward, they undergo intensive chemical processing to separate and purify the valuable materials.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“It requires as much as 10 tons of chemical input to produce one ton of critical material recovered from the mining or battery recycling feedstock,” says Smith. Operators can then sell the recaptured materials back into the supply chain, but suffer from wide swings in profitability due to uncertain market prices. Lithium prices have been the most volatile, having surged more than 400 percent before tumbling back to near-original levels in the past two years. Despite their poor economics and negative environmental impact, these processes remain the state of the art today.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;By contrast, SiTration is electrifying the critical-materials recovery process, improving efficiency, producing less chemical waste, and reducing the use of chemicals and heat. What’s more, the company’s processing technology is built to be highly adaptable, so it can handle all kinds of materials.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The core technology is based on work done at MIT to develop a novel type of membrane made from silicon, which is durable enough to withstand harsh chemicals and high temperatures while conducting electricity. It’s also highly tunable, meaning it can be modified or adjusted to suit different conditions or target specific materials.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;SiTration’s technology also incorporates electro-extraction, a technique that uses electrochemistry to further isolate and extract specific target materials. This powerful combination of methods in a single system makes it more efficient and effective at isolating and recovering valuable materials, Smith says. So depending on what needs to be separated or extracted, the filtration and electro-extraction processes are adjusted accordingly.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“We can produce membranes with pore sizes from the molecular scale up to the size of a human hair in diameter, and everything in between. Combined with the ability to electrify the membrane and separate based on a material’s electrochemical properties, this tunability allows us to target a vast array of different operations and separation applications across industrial fields,” says Smith.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Efficient access to materials like lithium, cobalt, and copper — and precious metals like platinum, gold, silver, palladium, and rare-earth elements — is key to unlocking innovation in business and sustainability as the world moves toward electrification and away from fossil fuels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This is an era when new materials are critical,” says Professor Jeffrey Grossman, co-founder and chief scientist of SiTration and the Morton and Claire Goulder and Family Professor in Environmental Systems at DMSE. “For so many technologies, they’re both the bottleneck and the opportunity, offering tremendous potential for non-incremental advances. And the role they’re having in commercialization and in entrepreneurship cannot be overstated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SiTration’s commercial frontier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith became interested in separation technology in 2013 as a PhD student in Grossman’s DMSE research group, which has focused on the design of new membrane materials for a range of applications. The two shared a curiosity about separation of critical materials and a hunger to advance the technology. After years of study under Grossman’s mentorship, and with support from several MIT incubators and foundations including the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab’s Solutions Program, the Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, the Kavanaugh Fellowship, MIT Sandbox, and Venture Mentoring Service, Smith was ready to officially form SiTration in 2020. Grossman has a seat on the board and plays an active role as a strategic and technical advisor.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Grossman is involved in several MIT spinoffs and embraces the different imperatives of research versus commercialization. “At SiTration, we’re driving this technology to work at scale. There’s something super exciting about that goal,” he says. “The challenges that come with scaling are very different than the challenges that come in a university lab.” At the same time, although not every research breakthrough becomes a commercial product, open-ended, curiosity-driven knowledge pursuit holds its own crucial value, he adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been rewarding for Grossman to see his technically gifted student and colleague develop a host of other skills the role of CEO demands. Getting out to the market and talking about the technology with potential partners, putting together a dynamic team, discovering the challenges facing industry, drumming up support, early on — those became the most pressing activities on Smith’s agenda.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“What’s most fun to me about being a CEO of an early-stage startup is that there are 100 different factors, most people-oriented, that you have to navigate every day. Each stakeholder has different motivations and objectives. And you basically try to fit that all together, to create value for our partners and customers, the company, and for society,” says Smith. “You start with just an idea, and you have to keep leveraging that to form a more and more tangible product, to multiply and progress commercial relationships, and do it all at an ever-expanding scale.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;MIT DNA runs deep in the nine-person company, with DMSE grad and former Grossman student Jatin Patil as director of product; Ahmed Helal, from MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, as vice president of research and development; Daniel Bregante, from the Department of Chemistry, as VP of technology; and Sarah Melvin, from the departments of Physics and Political Science, as VP of strategy and operations. Melvin is the first hire devoted to business development. Smith plans to continue expanding the team following the closing of the company’s seed round. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic alliances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a good communicator was important when it came to securing funding, Smith says. SiTration received $2.35 million in pre-seed funding in 2022 led by Azolla Ventures, which reserves its $239 million in investment capital for startups that would not otherwise easily obtain funding. “We invest only in solution areas that can achieve gigaton-scale climate impact by 2050,” says Matthew Nordan, a general partner at Azolla and now SiTration board member. The MIT-affiliated E14 Fund also contributed to the pre-seed round; Azolla and E14 both participated in the recent seed funding round.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“Brendan demonstrated an extraordinary ability to go from being a thoughtful scientist to a business leader and thinker who has punched way above his weight in engaging with customers and recruiting a well-balanced team and navigating tricky markets,” says Nordan.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One of SiTration’s first partnerships is with Rio Tinto, one of the largest mining companies in the world. As SiTration evaluated various uses cases in its early days, identifying critical materials as its target market, Rio Tinto was looking for partners to recover valuable metals such as cobalt and copper from the wastewater generated at mines. These metals were typically trapped in the water, creating harmful waste and resulting in lost revenue.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“We thought this was a great innovation challenge and posted it on our website to scout for companies to partner with who can help us solve this water challenge,” said Nick Gurieff, principal advisor for mine closure, in an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ilp.mit.edu/news/how-rfp-brought-two-companies-together-rio-tinto-and-sitration"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with MIT’s Industrial Liaison Program in 2023.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;At SiTration, mining was not yet a market focus, but Smith couldn’t help noticing that Rio Tinto’s needs were in alignment with what his young company offered. SiTration submitted its proposal in August 2022.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Gurieff said SiTration’s tunable membrane set it apart. The companies formed a business partnership in June 2023, with SiTration adjusting its membrane to handle mine wastewater and incorporating Rio Tinto feedback to refine the technology. After running tests with water from mine sites, SiTration will begin building a small-scale critical-materials recovery unit, followed by larger-scale systems processing up to 100 cubic meters of water an hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SiTration’s focused technology development with Rio Tinto puts it in a good position for future market growth, Smith says. “Every ounce of effort and resource we put into developing our product is geared towards creating real-world value. Having an industry-leading partner constantly validating our progress is a tremendous advantage.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a long time from the days when Smith began tinkering with tiny holes in silicon in Grossman’s DMSE lab. Now, they work together as business partners who are scaling up technology to meet a global need. Their joint passion for applying materials innovation to tough problems has served them well. “Materials science and engineering is an engine for a lot of the innovation that is happening today,” Grossman says. “When you look at all of the challenges we face to make the transition to a more sustainable planet, you realize how many of these are materials challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A trip to Ghana changed Sofia Martinez Galvez’s life. In 2021, she volunteered at a nonprofit that provides technology and digital literacy training to people in the West African country. As she was setting up computers and connecting cables, Martinez SM ʼ23 witnessed extreme poverty. The experience was transformative. That same year, she left her job in quantum cryptography in Spain and enrolled in the&amp;nbsp;MITx MicroMasters online program in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/"&gt;Data, Economics, and Design of Policy&lt;/a&gt; (DEDP), which teaches learners how to use data-driven tools to help end global poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;By 2023, Martinez completed the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/academic-programs/masters-programs/masters-data-economics-and-design-policy-dedp"&gt;MIT DEDP master’s program&lt;/a&gt;. Today, she is the co-founder of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.learningalliance.net/"&gt;Learning Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a new nonprofit that will counter sub-Saharan Africa’s learning crisis by introducing evidence-based teaching practices to teachers. She plans to move to Africa this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“If someone told me a few years ago, when I was doing research in quantum physics, that I would be starting my own organization at the intersection of education and poverty, I would have said they were crazy,” Martinez says. “From my first MicroMasters course, I knew I made the right choice. The instructors used mathematics, models, and data to understand society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Since 2017, the MicroMasters in DEDP program — jointly led by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"&gt;Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab&lt;/a&gt; (J-PAL) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Open Learning&lt;/a&gt; — has been bringing together former nurses, lawyers, software developers, and others who are ready to make a career change and an impact on the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new way to combat poverty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The MicroMasters in DEDP curricula is based on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/esther-duflo-abhijit-banerjee-win-2019-nobel-prize-economics-1014"&gt;Nobel Prize-winning work&lt;/a&gt; of MIT faculty members Esther Duflo, the Abdul Latif Jameel Professor of Poverty Alleviation and Development Economics, and Abhijit Banerjee, the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The pair used a key feature of laboratory science — randomized control trials — and applied it to development economics. For example, to test the efficacy of a new education initiative, researchers could randomly assign individuals to either participate in the program, known as the treatment group, or not, known as the control group. The difference in outcomes can be attributed to the new program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This approach has fundamentally changed how antipoverty programs are designed and evaluated around the world. It has already boosted&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Banerjee%2C%20Duflo%2C%20Glennerster%2C%20Kothari-%20Incentives%20.pdf"&gt;immunization rates&lt;/a&gt; in India, reduced&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/financial-incentives-and-adolescent-empowerment-program-reduce-child-marriage-rural"&gt;child marriages&lt;/a&gt; in Bangladesh, and increased&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Addressing%20Absence.pdf"&gt;school attendance&lt;/a&gt; in Kenya.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Duflo and Banerjee’s research created a new way forward for poverty alleviation, but there are too few people skilled in evidence-based development economics to bring about meaningful change, says Sara Fisher Ellison, faculty director of the MicroMasters and master’s programs in DEDP and a senior lecturer in the MIT Department of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It is vitally important that we have people all over the world who have the skills to run randomized control trials, to read the literature from these trials, and interpret the results to policymakers,” Ellison says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Andrea Salem was an economics undergraduate student in Switzerland who was unsure about his career when Duflo and Banerjee received their Nobel Prize. Their recognition introduced Salem to a field he barely knew existed, and set him on a path toward using economics to make an impact in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He completed the MicroMasters in DEDP credential and included it in his application for the Paris School of Economics (PSE). Currently taking a gap year from PSE, Salem has an internship with J-PAL’s Morocco Employment Lab. In this role, he works with government officials to evaluate education reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“To get to know the world in all its diversity is a gift,” Salem says. “To live and do research in the same country is a reminder of the important work I’m doing and how much more needs to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the DEDP program works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The MicroMasters in DEDP program is open to anyone with a reliable internet connection. Students choose either a track in public policy, which focuses on key issues in high-income countries, or international development, which examines problems prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. They take a rigorous course load in economics, probability and statistics, and data analysis. The program balances flexibility with structure. Students go at their preferred pace in earning the credential, but each course is instructor-led, providing participants with a community of global learners who can regularly participate in webinars and discussion forums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Students who complete and pass proctored exams in five courses earn a credential. The MicroMasters in DEDP program has awarded more than 10,000 certificates for passed courses and 1,000 DEDP MicroMasters credentials. Credential holders may continue their education by applying to a master’s program at MIT or at one of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/pathways-masters/"&gt;19 pathway universities&lt;/a&gt; worldwide that either recognize the MicroMasters in DEDP credential in admissions or offer academic credit for the credential as part of an accelerated graduate program. The credential itself is also valuable for professionals as they advance their careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The courses are free to audit; there is a fee for each proctored exam. Exam fees are on a sliding scale, ranging from $250 to $1,000, based on a learner’s income and location. DEDP also offers a lottery, available to people who earn less than $10,000 a year, that discounts the price of one course to $100. Martinez was a beneficiary of the lottery in 2021. Without it, she says it would have taken her longer to earn her credential and apply to the master’s program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing passion and pedigree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Yann Bourgeois SM ʼ22 had a rewarding nursing career working in operating rooms and intensive care units in Belgium. This job gave Bourgeois a firsthand understanding of what happens when human health and needs are neglected. Driven to make a global impact, Bourgeois discovered the master’s in DEDP program while studying public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Having overcome personal challenges and socioeconomic adversity, Bourgeois was not sure MIT would consider him for graduate school. When he learned that the MicroMasters credential played an important role in admissions, Bourgeois became hopeful. He enrolled in five MicroMasters in DEDP classes at the same time. It was a bold move for someone who had not taken a math class beyond statistics, but he was eager to submit his graduate school application. By 2022, Bourgeois was an MIT graduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My background doesn't matter,” Bourgeois says. “The fact that I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life at 14 or 15 doesn’t matter. All that matters is the skills and passion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Bourgeois now works as a labor economist at the World Bank in Washington. His job focuses on improving labor conditions and promoting equitable economic opportunities. His MIT education equipped Bourgeois with rigorous analytical tools to address complex economic problems on an international scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Like Bourgeois, Martinez did not believe she had the qualifications to apply for the master’s in DEDP program. Then, she read students’ profiles online and learned about their wide-ranging experiences. After learning more about the program’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/academic-programs/masters-programs/masters-data-economics-and-design-policy-dedp"&gt;inverted admissions process&lt;/a&gt;, which prioritizes performance in relevant courses over traditional credentials, she realized that the opportunity might not be out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Evidence-based development needs people from very diverse backgrounds,” Martinez says. “And I’m proof that you don’t need the ‘right’ background to work in development economics. The fight against global poverty needs everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Improving working environments amid environmental distress</title>

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In less than a decade, MIT economist Namrata Kala has produced a corpus of work too rich, inventive, and diverse to be easily summarized. Let’s try anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kala, an associate professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, often studies environmental problems and their effects on workers and firms, with implications for government policy, corporate managers, and anyone concerned about climate change. She also examines the effects of innovation on productivity, from farms to factories, and scrutinizes firm organization in light of such major changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kala has published papers on topics including the long-term effects of climate change on agriculture in Africa and India; the impact of mechanization on farmers’ incomes; the extent to which linguistic differences create barriers to trade; and even the impact of LED light bulbs on factory productivity. Characteristically, Kala looks at issues of global scale and pinpoints their effects at the level of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider one paper Kala and two colleagues published a couple of years ago, about the effects of air pollution on garment factory workers in India. The scholars examined patterns of particulate-matter pollution and linked that to detailed, worker-level data about how productive workers were along the production line. The study shows that air pollution damages sewing productivity, and that some managers (not all) are adept at recognizing which workers are most affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What emerges from much of this work is a real-time picture of human adaptation in a time of environmental distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like I’m part of a long tradition of trying to understand resilience and adaptation, but now in the face of a changing world,” Kala says. “Understanding interventions that are good for resilience while the world is changing is what motivates me, along with the fact that the vast majority of the world is vulnerable to events that may impact economic growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her research and teaching, Kala was awarded tenure at MIT last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joining academia, then staying in it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kala, who grew up in Punjab, India, was long mindful of big issues pertaining to society, the economy, and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Growing up in India, it’s very difficult not to be interested in the some of the questions that are important for development and environmental economics,” Kala says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Kala did not expect that interest to lead her into academia. She attended Delhi University as an undergraduate, earning her degree with honors in economics while expecting to find a job in the area of development. To help facilitate that, Kala enrolled in a one-year master’s program at Yale University, in international and development economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that year was out, Kala had a new realization: Studying development problems was integral to solving them. Academia is not on the sidelines when it comes to development, but helps generate crucial knowledge to foster better and smarter growth policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I came to Yale for a one-year master’s because I didn’t know if I wanted to be in a university for another two years,” Kala says. “I wanted to work on problems in the world. And that’s when I became enthralled with research. It was this wonderful year where I could study anything, and it completely changed my perspective on what I could do next. So I did the PhD, and that’s how I became an economist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After receiving her PhD in 2015, Kala spent the next two years supported by a Prize Fellowship in Economics, History, and Politics at Harvard University and a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT’s own Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL). In 2017, she joined the MIT faculty on a full-time basis, and has remained at the Institute since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source material for Kala’s studies varies widely, though in all cases she is looking for ways to construct well-defined empirical studies tackling major questions, with key issues often revealed in policy or firm details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I find reading stuff about policy reform strangely interesting,” she quips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development, but with environmental quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, sometimes the spark for Kala’s studies comes from her own broad knowledge of past policy reforms, combined with an ability to locate data that reveals their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, one working paper Kala and a colleague recently completed looks at an Indian policy to move industrial firms out of Delhi in order to help solve the city’s pollution problems; the policy randomly relocated companies in an industrial belt around the city. But what effect did this have on the firms? After examining the records of 20,000 companies, the researchers found these firms’ survival rate was 8 percent to 20 percent lower than if the policy called for them to be clustered more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That finding suggests how related environmental policies can be designed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This environmental policy was important in that it improved air quality in Delhi, but there’s a way to do that which also reduces the cost on firms,” Kala says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kala says she expects India to be the locus of many, though hardly all, of her future studies. The country provides a wide range of opportunities for research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“India currently has both the largest number of poor people in the world as well as 21 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world,” Kala says. “Clearly, the tradeoff between development and environmental quality is extremely salient, and we need progress in understanding industrial policies that are at least environmentally neutral or improving environmental quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kala will continue to look for new ways to take pressing, large-scale issues and study their effects in daily life. But the fact that her work ranges so widely is not just due to the places she studies; it is also because of the place she studies them from. MIT, she believes, has provided her with an environment of its own, which in this case enhances her own productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing that helps a lot is having colleagues and co-authors to bounce ideas of off,” Kala says. “Sloan is the heart of so much interdisciplinary work. That is one big reason why I’ve had a broad set of interests and continue to work on many things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At Sloan,” she adds, “there are people doing fascinating things that I’m happy to listen to, as well as people in different disciplines working on related things who have a perspective I find extremely enriching. There are excellent economists, but I also go into seminars about work or productivity or the environment and come away with a perspective I don’t think I could have come up with myself.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>A data-driven approach to making better choices</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Imagine a world in which some important decision — a judge’s sentencing recommendation, a child’s treatment protocol, which person or business should receive a loan — was made more reliable because a well-designed algorithm helped a key decision-maker arrive at a better choice. A new MIT economics course is investigating these interesting possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Class 14.163 (Algorithms and Behavioral Science) is a new cross-disciplinary course focused on behavioral economics, which studies the cognitive capacities and limitations of human beings. The course was co-taught this past spring by assistant professor of economics&amp;nbsp;Ashesh Rambachan and visiting lecturer Sendhil Mullainathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rambachan, who’s also a primary investigator with MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, studies the economic applications of machine learning, focusing on algorithmic tools that drive decision-making in the criminal justice system and consumer lending markets. He also develops methods for determining causation using cross-sectional and dynamic data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mullainathan will soon join the MIT departments of&amp;nbsp;Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and&amp;nbsp;Economics as a professor. His research uses machine learning to understand complex problems in human behavior, social policy, and medicine. Mullainathan co-founded the&amp;nbsp;Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The new course’s goals are both scientific (to understand people) and policy-driven (to improve society by improving decisions). Rambachan believes that machine-learning algorithms provide new tools for both the scientific and applied goals of behavioral economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The course investigates the deployment of computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), economics, and machine learning in service of improved outcomes and reduced instances of bias in decision-making,” Rambachan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There are opportunities, Rambachan believes, for constantly evolving digital tools like AI, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs) to help reshape everything from discriminatory practices in criminal sentencing to health-care outcomes among underserved populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Students learn how to use machine learning tools with three main objectives: to understand what they do and how they do it, to formalize behavioral economics insights so they compose well within machine learning tools, and to understand areas and topics where the integration of behavioral economics and algorithmic tools might be most fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Students also produce ideas, develop associated research, and see the bigger picture. They’re led to understand where an insight fits and see where the broader research agenda is leading. Participants can think critically about what supervised LLMs can (and cannot) do, to understand how to integrate those capacities with the models and insights of behavioral economics, and to recognize the most fruitful areas for the application of what investigations uncover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dangers of subjectivity and bias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;According to Rambachan, behavioral economics acknowledges that biases and mistakes exist throughout our choices, even absent algorithms. “The data used by our algorithms exist outside computer science and machine learning, and instead are often produced by people,” he continues. “Understanding behavioral economics is therefore essential to understanding the effects of algorithms and how to better build them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Rambachan sought to make the course accessible regardless of attendees’ academic backgrounds. The class included advanced degree students from a variety of disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;By offering students a cross-disciplinary, data-driven approach to investigating and discovering ways in which algorithms might improve problem-solving and decision-making, Rambachan hopes to build a foundation on which to redesign existing systems of jurisprudence, health care, consumer lending, and industry, to name a few areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Understanding how data are generated can help us understand bias,” Rambachan says. “We can ask questions about producing a better outcome than what currently exists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useful tools for re-imagining social operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Economics doctoral student Jimmy Lin was skeptical about the claims Rambachan and Mullainathan made when the class began, but changed his mind as the course continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Ashesh and Sendhil started with two provocative claims: The future of behavioral science research will not exist without AI, and the future of AI research will not exist without behavioral science,” Lin says. “Over the course of the semester, they deepened my understanding of both fields and walked us through numerous examples of how economics informed AI research and vice versa.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lin, who’d previously done research in computational biology, praised the instructors’ emphasis on the importance of a “producer mindset,” thinking about the next decade of research rather than the previous decade. “That’s especially important in an area as interdisciplinary and fast-moving as the intersection of AI and economics — there isn’t an old established literature, so you’re forced to ask new questions, invent new methods, and create new bridges,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The speed of change to which Lin alludes is a draw for him, too. “We’re seeing black-box AI methods facilitate breakthroughs in math, biology, physics, and other scientific disciplines,” Lin&amp;nbsp; says. “AI can change the way we approach intellectual discovery as researchers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An interdisciplinary future for economics and social systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Studying traditional economic tools and enhancing their value with AI may yield game-changing shifts in how institutions and organizations teach and empower leaders to make choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We’re learning to track shifts, to adjust frameworks and better understand how to deploy tools in service of a common language,” Rambachan says. “We must continually interrogate the intersection of human judgment, algorithms, AI, machine learning, and LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lin enthusiastically recommended the course regardless of students’ backgrounds. “Anyone broadly interested in algorithms in society, applications of AI across academic disciplines, or AI as a paradigm for scientific discovery should take this class,” he says. “Every lecture felt like a goldmine of perspectives on research, novel application areas, and inspiration on how to produce new, exciting ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The course, Rambachan says, argues that better-built algorithms can improve decision-making across disciplines. “By building connections between economics, computer science, and machine learning, perhaps we can automate the best of human choices to improve outcomes while minimizing or eliminating the worst,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lin remains excited about the course’s as-yet unexplored possibilities. “It’s a class that makes you excited about the future of research and your own role in it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Getting to systemic sustainability</title>

  <description><![CDATA[At the 2024 Earth Day Colloquium, World Resource Institute President and CEO Ani Dasgupta says systemic changes in a handful of countries will be critical to meeting global emissions goals.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Calvin Hennick | MIT Energy Initiative</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Add up the commitments from the Paris Agreement, the Glasgow Climate Pact, and various commitments made by cities, countries, and businesses, and the world would be able to hold the global average temperature increase to 1.9 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, says Ani Dasgupta, the president and chief executive officer of the World Resources Institute (WRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that is well above the 1.5 C threshold that many scientists agree would limit the most severe impacts of climate change, it is below the 2.0 degree threshold that could lead to even more catastrophic impacts, such as the collapse of ice sheets and a 30-foot rise in sea levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Dasgupta notes, actions have so far not matched up with commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a huge gap between commitment and outcomes,” Dasgupta said during his talk, “Energizing the global transition,” at the 2024 Earth Day Colloquium co-hosted by the MIT Energy Initiative and MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, and sponsored by the Climate Nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dasgupta noted that oil companies did $6 trillion worth of business across the world last year — $1 trillion more than they were planning. About 7 percent of the world’s remaining tropical forests were destroyed during that same time, he added, and global inequality grew even worse than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of these things were illegal, because the system we have today produces these outcomes,” he said. “My point is that it’s not one thing that needs to change. The whole system needs to change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People, climate, and nature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dasgupta, who previously held positions in nonprofits in India and at the World Bank, is a recognized leader in sustainable cities, poverty alleviation, and building cultures of inclusion. Under his leadership, WRI, a global research nonprofit that studies sustainable practices with the goal of fundamentally transforming the world’s food, land and water, energy, and cities, adopted a new five-year strategy called “Getting the Transition Right for People, Nature, and Climate 2023-2027.” It focuses on creating new economic opportunities to meet people’s essential needs, restore nature, and rapidly lower emissions, while building resilient communities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, during his talk, Dasgupta said that his organization has moved away from talking about initiatives in terms of their impact on greenhouse gas emissions — instead taking a more holistic view of sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no net zero without nature,” Dasgupta said. He showed a slide with a graphic illustrating potential progress toward net-zero goals. “If nature gets diminished, that chart becomes even steeper. It’s very steep right now, but natural systems absorb carbon dioxide. So, if the natural systems keep getting destroyed, that curve becomes harder and harder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A focus on people is necessary, Dasgupta said, in part because of the unequal climate impacts that the rich and the poor are likely to face in the coming years. “If you made it to this room, you will not be impacted by climate change,” he said. “You have resources to figure out what to do about it. The people who get impacted are people who don’t have resources. It is immensely unfair. Our belief is, if we don’t do climate policy that helps people directly, we won’t be able to make progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Dasgupta stressed that systemic change is needed to bring carbon emissions in line with long-term climate goals, he made the case that it is unrealistic to implement this change around the globe all at once. “This transition will not happen in 196 countries at the same time,” he said. “The question is, how do we get to the tipping point so that it happens at scale? We’ve worked the past few years to ask the question, what is it you need to do to create this tipping point for change?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at WRI looked for countries that are large producers of carbon, those with substantial tropical forest cover, and those with large quantities of people living in poverty. “We basically tried to draw a map of, where are the biggest challenges for climate change?” Dasgupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That map features a relative handful of countries, including the United States, Mexico, China, Brazil, South Africa, India, and Indonesia. Dasgupta said, “Our argument is that, if we could figure out and focus all our efforts to help these countries transition, that will create a ripple effect — of understanding technology, understanding the market, understanding capacity, and understanding the politics of change that will unleash how the rest of these regions will bring change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotlight on the subcontinent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dasgupta used one of these countries, his native India, to illustrate the nuanced challenges and opportunities presented by various markets around the globe. In India, he noted, there are around 3 million projected jobs tied to the country’s transition to renewable energy. However, that number is dwarfed by the 10 to 12 million jobs per year the Indian economy needs to create simply to keep up with population growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every developing country faces this question — how to keep growing in a way that reduces their carbon footprint,” Dasgupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five states in India worked with WRI to pool their buying power and procure 5,000 electric buses, saving 60 percent of the cost as a result. Over the next two decades, Dasgupta said, the fleet of electric buses in those five states is expected to increase to 800,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Indian state of Rajasthan, Dasgupta said, 59 percent of power already comes from solar energy. At times, Rajasthan produces more solar than it can use, and officials are exploring ways to either store the excess energy or sell it to other states. But in another state, Jharkhand, where much of the country’s coal is sourced, only 5 percent of power comes from solar. Officials in Jharkhand have reached out to WRI to discuss how to transition their energy economy, as they recognize that coal will fall out of favor in the future, Dasgupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The complexities of the transition are enormous in a country this big,” Dasgupta said. “This is true in most large countries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The road ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges ahead, the colloquium was also marked by notes of optimism. In his opening remarks, Robert Stoner, the founding director of the MIT Tata Center for Technology and Design, pointed out how much progress has been made on environmental cleanup since the first Earth Day in 1970. “The world was a very different, much dirtier, place in many ways,” Stoner said. “Our air was a mess, our waterways were a mess, and it was beginning to be noticeable. Since then, Earth Day has become an important part of the fabric of American and global society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dasgupta said that the world presently lacks the “orchestration” among various stakeholders needed to bring climate change under control, he expressed hope that collaboration in key countries could accelerate progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I strongly believe that what we need is a very different way of collaborating radically — across organizations like yours, organizations like ours, businesses, and governments,” Dasgupta said. “Otherwise, this transition will not happen at the scale and speed we need.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[Honing her values and career path through her D-Lab classes, the MIT senior sets her sights on leveling inequalities in global health.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Nancy Adams | MIT D-Lab</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sophia Chen, a fifth-year senior double majoring in mechanical engineering and art and design, learned about &lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu"&gt;MIT D-Lab&lt;/a&gt; when she was a Florida middle schooler. She drove with her family from their home in Clearwater to Tampa to an MIT informational open house for prospective students. There, she heard about a moringa seed press that had been developed by D-Lab students. Those students, Kwami Williams ’12 and Emily Cunningham (a cross-registered Harvard University student), went on to found &lt;a href="https://moringaconnect.com/"&gt;MoringaConnect&lt;/a&gt; with a goal of increasing Ghanaian farmer incomes. Over the past 12 years, the company has done just that, sometimes by a factor of 10 or more, by selling to wholesalers and establishing their own line of moringa skin and hair care products, as well as nutritional supplements and teas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember getting chills,” says Sophia. “I was so in awe. MIT had always been my dream college growing up, but hearing this particular story truly cemented that dream. I even talked about D-Lab during my admissions interview. Once I came to MIT, I knew I had to take a D-Lab class — and now, at the end of my five years, I've taken four.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking four D-Lab classes during her undergraduate years may make Sophia exceptional, though not unusual. Of the nearly 4,000 enrollments in D-Lab classes over the past 22 years, as many as 20 percent took at least two classes, and many take three or more by the time the graduate. For Sophia, her D-Lab classes were a logical progression that both confirmed and expanded her career goals in global medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centering the role of project community partners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia’s first D-Lab class was 2.722J / EC.720 (&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/academics/classes/d-lab-design"&gt;D-Lab: Design&lt;/a&gt;). Like all D-Lab classes, D-Lab: Design is project-based and centers the knowledge and contributions of each project’s community partner. Her team worked with a group in Uganda called Safe Water Harvesters on a project aimed at creating a solar-powered atmospheric water harvester using desiccants. They focused on early research and development for the desiccant technology by running tests for vapor absorption. Safe Water Harvesters designed the parameters and goals of the project and collaborated with the students remotely throughout the semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe Water Harvesters’ role in the project was key to the project’s success. “At D-Lab, I learned the importance of understanding that solutions in international development must come from the voices and needs of people whom the intervention is trying to serve,” she says. “Some of the first questions we were taught to ask are ‘what materials and manufacturing processes are available?’ and ‘how is this technology going to be maintained by the community?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The link between water access and gender inequity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electing to join the water harvesting project in Uganda was no accident. The previous summer, Sophia had interned with a startup targeting the spread of cholera in developing areas by engineering a new type of rapid detection technology that would sample from users’ local water sources. From there, she joined Professor Amos Winter’s Global Engineering and Research (GEAR) Lab as an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program student and worked on a point-of-use desalination unit for households in India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking EC.715 (&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/academics/classes/d-lab-water-sanitation-and-hygiene"&gt;D-Lab: Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene&lt;/a&gt;) was a logical next step for Sophia. “This class was life-changing,” she says. “I was already passionate about clean water access and global resource equity, but I quickly discovered the complexity of WASH not just as an issue of poverty but as an issue of gender.” She joined a project spearheaded by a classmate from Nepal, which aimed to address the social taboos surrounding menstruation among Nepalese schoolgirls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This class and project helped me realize that water insecurity and gender inequality — especially gender-based violence — ​are highly intertwined,” comments Sophia. This plays out in a variety of ways. Where there is poor sanitation infrastructure in schools, girls often miss classes or drop out altogether when menstruating. And where water is scarce, women and girls often walk miles to collect water to accommodate daily drinking, cooking, and hygiene needs. During this trek, they are vulnerable to assault and the pressure to engage in transactional sex at water access points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It became clear to me that women are disproportionately affected by water insecurity, and that water is key to understanding women’s empowerment,” comments Sophia, “and that I wanted to keep learning about the field of development and how it intersects with gender!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in fall 2023, Sophia took both 11.025/EC.701 (&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/academics/classes/d-lab-development"&gt;D-Lab: Development&lt;/a&gt;) and WGS.277/EC.718 (&lt;a href="https://d-lab.mit.edu/academics/classes/d-lab-gender-development"&gt;D-Lab: Gender and Development)&lt;/a&gt;. In D-Lab: Development, her team worked with &lt;a href="https://tatirano.org/"&gt;Tatirano&lt;/a&gt;, a nongovernmental organization in Madagascar, to develop a vapor-condensing chamber for a water desalination system, a prototype they were able to test and iterate in Madagascar at the end of the semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting out into the world through D-Lab fieldwork&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fieldwork with D-Lab is an eye-opening experience that anyone could benefit from,” says Sophia. “It’s easy to get lost in the MIT and tech bubble. But there’s a whole world out there with people who live such different lives than many of us, and we can learn even more from them than we can from our psets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Sophia’s D-Lab: Gender and Development class, she worked with the &lt;a href="https://sepke.org/about-us/"&gt;Society Empowerment Project&lt;/a&gt; in Kenya, ultimately traveling there during MIT’s Independent Activities Period last January. In Kenya, she worked with her team to run a workshop with teen parents to identify risk factors prior to pregnancy and postpartum challenges, in order to then ideate and develop solutions such as social programs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through my fieldwork in Kenya and Madagascar,” says Sophia, “it became clear how important it is to create community-based solutions that are led and maintained by community members. Solutions need community input, leadership, and trust. Ultimately, this is the only way to have long-lasting, high-impact, sustainable change. One of my D-Lab trip leaders said that you cannot import solutions. I hope all engineers recognize the significance of this statement. It is our duty as engineers and scientists to make the world a better place while carrying values of empathy, patience, and respect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursuing passion and purpose at the intersection of medicine, technology, and policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduation in June, Sophia will be traveling to South Africa through MISTI Africa to help with a clinical trial and community outreach. She then intends to pursue a master's in global health and apply to medical school, with the goal of working in global health at the intersection of medicine, technology, and policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is no understatement to say that D-Lab has played a central role in helping me discover what I’m passionate about and what my purpose is in life,” she says. “I hope to dedicate my career towards solving global health inequity and gender inequality.” ​&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two MIT scholars, each with a strong entrepreneurial drive, have received 2024 Kavanaugh Fellowship awards, advancing their quest to turn pioneering research into profitable commercial enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://kavfellow.mit.edu/"&gt; Kavanaugh Translational Fellows Program&lt;/a&gt; gives scholars training to lead organizations that will bring their research to market. PhD candidates Grant Knappe and Arjav Shah are this year’s recipients. Knappe is developing a drug delivery platform for an emerging class of medicines called nucleic acid therapeutics. Shah is using hydrogel microparticles to clean up water polluted by heavy metals and other contaminants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knappe and Shah will begin their fellowship with years of entrepreneurial expertise under their belts. They’ve developed and refined their business plans through MIT’s innovation ecosystem, including the Sandbox, the Legatum Center, the Venture Mentoring Service, the National Science Foundation’s I-Corps Program, and Blueprint by The Engine. Now, the yearlong Kavanaugh Fellowship will give the scholars time to focus exclusively on testing their business plans and exercising decision-making skills — critical to startup success — with the guidance of MIT mentors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a testament to the support and direction they’ve received from the MIT community that their entrepreneurial aspirations have evolved and matured over time,” says Michael J. Cima, program director for the Kavanaugh program and the David H. Koch Professor of Engineering in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2016, the Kavanaugh program was instrumental in helping past fellows launch several robust startups, including low-carbon cement manufacturer Sublime Systems and SiTration, which is using a new type of filtration membrane to extract critical materials such as lithium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A safer way to deliver breakthrough medicines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nucleic acid therapeutics, including mRNA and CRISPR, are disrupting today’s clinical landscape thanks to their promise of targeting disease treatment according to genetic blueprints. But the first methods of delivering these molecules to the body used viruses as their transport, raising&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9876036/"&gt; patient safety concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans have figured out how to engineer certain viruses found in nature to deliver specific cargoes [for disease treatment],” says Knappe. “But because they look like viruses, the human immune system sees them as a danger signal and creates an immune reaction that can be harmful to patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the safety profile issues of viral delivery, researchers turned to non-viral technologies that use lipid nanoparticle technology, a mixture of different lipid-like materials, assembled into particles to protect the mRNA therapeutic from getting degraded before it reaches a cell of interest. “Because they don’t look like viruses there, the immune system generally tolerates them,” adds Knappe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent data show lipid nanoparticles can now target the lung, opening the potential for novel treatments of deadly cancers and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knappe’s work in MIT’s Bathe BioNanoLab focused on building such a non-viral delivery platform based on a different technology: nucleic acid nanoparticles, which combine the attractive components of both viral and non-viral systems. Knappe will spend his Kavanaugh Fellowship year developing proof-of-concept data for his drug delivery method and building the team and funding needed to commercialize the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A PhD candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering (ChemE), Knappe was initially attracted to MIT because of its intellectual openness. “You can work with any faculty member in other departments. I wasn't restricted to the chemical engineering faculty,” says Knappe, whose supervisor, Professor Mark Bathe, is in the Department of Biological Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knappe, who is from New Jersey, welcomes the challenges that will come in his Kavanaugh year, including the need to pinpoint the right story that will convince venture capitalists and other funders to bet on his technology. Attracting talent is also top of mind. “How do you convince really talented people that have a lot of opportunities to work on what you work on? Building the first team is going to be critical,” he says. The network Knappe has been building in his years at MIT is paying dividends now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting “forever chemicals” in water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That network includes Shah. The two fellows met when they worked on the &lt;em&gt;MIT Science Policy Review&lt;/em&gt;, a student-run journal concerned with the intersection of science, technology, and policy. Knappe and Shah did not compete directly academically but used their biweekly coffee walks as a welcome sounding board. Naturally, they were pleased when they found out they had both been chosen for the Kavanaugh Fellowship. So far, they have been too busy to celebrate over a beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are good collaborators with research, as well,” says Shah. “Now we’re going on this entrepreneurial journey together. It’s been exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah is a PhD candidate in ChemE’s Chemical Engineering Practice program. He got interested in the global imperative for cleaner water at a young age. His hometown of Surat is the heart of India’s textile industry. “Growing up, it wasn’t hard to see the dye-colored water flowing into your rivers and streams,” Shah says. “Playing a role in fostering positive change in water treatment fills me with a profound sense of purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah’s work, broadly, is to clean toxic chemicals called micropollutants from water in an efficient and sustainable manner. “It’s humanly impossible to turn a blind eye to our water problems,” he says, which can be categorized as accessibility, availability, and quality. Water problems are global and complex, not just because of the technological challenges but also sociopolitical ones, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufactured chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), or “forever chemicals,” are &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/forever-chemicals-called-pfas-show-your-food-clothes-and-home" target="_blank"&gt;in the news&lt;/a&gt; these days. PFAS, which go into making nonstick cookware and waterproof clothing, are just one of more than 10,000 such emerging contaminants that have leached into water streams. “These are extremely difficult to remove using existing systems because of their chemical diversity and low concentrations,” Shah says. “The concentrations are akin to dropping an aspirin tablet in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.” But no less toxic for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab at MIT, Shah is working with Devashish Gokhale, a fellow PhD student, and Patrick S. Doyle, the Robert T. Haslam (1911) Professor of Chemical Engineering, to commercialize an&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/zwitterionic-hydrogels-swiftly-eliminate-micropollutants-from-water-0109"&gt; innovative microparticle technology&lt;/a&gt;, hydroGel, to remove these micropollutants in an effective, facile, and sustainable manner. Hydrogels are a broad class of polymer materials that can hold large quantities of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our materials are like Boba beads. We are trying to save the world with our Boba beads,” says Shah with a laugh. “And we have functionalized these particles with tunable chemistries to target different micropollutants in a single unit operation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to its outsized environmental impact, industrial water is the first application Shah is targeting. Today, wastewater treatment emits&lt;a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/news/sewage-plants-overlooked-co2-source-20840"&gt; more than 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions&lt;/a&gt;, which is more than the shipping industry’s emissions, for example. The current state of the art for removing micropollutants in the industry is to use activated carbon filters. “[This technology] comes from coal, so it’s unsustainable,” Shah says. And the activated carbon filters are hard to reuse. “Our particles are reusable, theoretically infinitely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very excited to be able to take advantage of the mentorship we have from the Kavanaugh team to take this technology to its next inflection point, so that we are ready to go out in the market and start making a huge impact,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A dream community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah and Knappe have become adept at navigating the array of support and mentorship opportunities MIT has to offer. Shah worked with a small team of seasoned professionals in the water space from the MIT Venture Mentoring Service. “They’ve helped us every step of the way as we think about commercializing the technology,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah worked with MIT Sandbox, which provides a seed grant to help find the right product-market fit. He is also a fellow with the &lt;a href="https://legatum.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on entrepreneurship in global growth markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re exploring the potential for this technology and its application in a lot of different markets, including India. Because that’s close to my heart,” Shah says. “The Legatum community has been unique, where you can have those extremely hard conversations, confront yourself with those fears, and then talk it out with the group of fellows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab, or J-WAFS, has been an integral part of Shah’s journey with research and commercialization support through its Solutions Grant and a travel award to the Stockholm World Water Week in August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knappe has also taken advantage of many innovation programs, including MIT’s Blueprint by the Engine, which helps researchers explore commercial opportunities of their work, plus programs outside of MIT but with strong on-campus ties such as Nucleate Activator and Frequency Bio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was during one of these programs that he was inspired by two postdocs working in Bathe’s lab and spinning out biotech startups from their research, Floris Engelhardt and James Banal. Engelhardt helped spearhead&lt;a href="https://kanotherapeutics.com/platform/"&gt; Kano Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, and Banal launched&lt;a href="https://www.cache-dna.com/"&gt; Cache DNA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was passively absorbing and watching everything that they were going through and what they were excited about and challenged with. I still talk to them pretty regularly to this day,” Knappe says. “It’s been really great to have them as continual mentors, throughout my PhD and as I transition out of the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah says he is grateful not only for being selected for the Kavanaugh Fellowship but to MIT as a community. “MIT has been more than a dream come true,” he says. He will have the opportunity to explore a different side of the institution as he enters the MBA program at MIT Sloan School of Management this fall. Shah expects this program, along with his Kavanaugh training, will supply the skills he needs to scale the business so it can make a difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always keep coming back to the question ‘How does what I do matter to the person on the street?’ This guides me to look at the bigger picture, to contextualize my research to solving important problems,” Shah says. “So many great technologies are being worked on each day, but only a minuscule fraction make it to the market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knappe is equally dedicated to serving a larger purpose. “With the right infrastructure, between basic fundamental science, conducted in academia, funded by government, and then translated by companies, we can make products that could improve everyone’s life across the world,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past Kavanaugh Fellows are credited with spearheading commercial outfits that have indeed made a difference. This year’s fellows are poised to follow their lead. But first they will have that beer together to celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[At the 2024 MIT Energy Iniative Spring Symposium, experts weighed whether hydrogen stored in the earth might be a practical energy source of the future. ]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1987 in a village in Mali, workers were digging a water well when they felt a rush of air. One of the workers was smoking a cigarette, and the air caught fire, burning a clear blue flame. The well was capped at the time, but in 2012, it was tapped to provide energy for the village, powering a generator for nine years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fuel source: geologic hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, hydrogen has been discussed as a potentially revolutionary fuel. But efforts to produce “green” hydrogen (splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity), “grey” hydrogen (making hydrogen from methane and releasing the biproduct carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into the atmosphere), “brown” hydrogen (produced through the gasification of coal), and “blue” hydrogen (making hydrogen from methane but capturing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) have thus far proven either expensive and/or energy-intensive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter geologic hydrogen. Also known as “orange,” “gold,” “white,” “natural,” and even “clear” hydrogen, geologic hydrogen is generated by natural geochemical processes in the Earth’s crust. While there is still much to learn, a growing number of researchers and industry leaders are hopeful that it may turn out to be an abundant and affordable resource lying right beneath our feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty about this,” noted Robert Stoner, the founding director of the MIT Tata Center for Technology and Design, in his opening remarks at the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) Spring Symposium. “But the prospect of readily producible clean hydrogen showing up all over the world is a potential near-term game changer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new hope for hydrogen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This April, MITEI gathered researchers, industry leaders, and academic experts from around MIT and the world to discuss the challenges and opportunities posed by geologic hydrogen in a daylong symposium entitled “Geologic hydrogen: Are orange and gold the new green?” The field is so new that, until a year ago, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)’s website incorrectly claimed that hydrogen only occurs naturally on Earth in compound forms, chemically bonded to other elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a common misconception that hydrogen doesn’t occur naturally on Earth,” said Geoffrey Ellis, a research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. He noted that natural hydrogen production tends to occur in different locations from where oil and natural gas are likely to be discovered, which explains why geologic hydrogen discoveries have been relatively rare, at least until recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Petroleum exploration is not targeting hydrogen,” Ellis said. “Companies are simply not really looking for it, they’re not interested in it, and oftentimes they don’t measure for it. The energy industry spends billions of dollars every year on exploration with very sophisticated technology, and still they drill dry holes all the time. So I think it’s naive to think that we would suddenly be finding hydrogen all the time when we’re not looking for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the number of researchers and startup energy companies with targeted efforts to characterize geologic hydrogen has increased over the past several years — and these searches have uncovered new prospects, said Mary Haas, a venture partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. “We’ve seen a dramatic uptick in exploratory activity, now that there is a focused effort by a small community worldwide.&amp;nbsp;At Breakthrough Energy, we are excited about the potential of this space, as well as our role in accelerating its progress,” she said. Haas noted that if geologic hydrogen could be produced at $1 per kilogram, this would be consistent with the DOE’s targeted “liftoff” point for the energy source. “If that happens,” she said, “it would be transformative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haas noted that only a small portion of identified hydrogen sites are currently under commercial exploration, and she cautioned that it’s not yet clear how large a role the resource might play in the transition to green energy. But, she said, “It’s worthwhile and important to find out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inventing a new energy subsector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geologic hydrogen is produced when water reacts with iron-rich minerals in rock. Researchers and industry are exploring how to stimulate this natural production by pumping water into promising deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any new exploration area, teams must ask a series of questions to qualify the site, said Avon McIntyre, the executive director of HyTerra Ltd., an Australian company focused on the exploration and production of geologic hydrogen. These questions include: Is the geology favorable? Does local legislation allow for exploration and production? Does the site offer a clear path to value? And what are the carbon implications of producing hydrogen at the site?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to be humble,” McIntyre said. “We can’t be too prescriptive and think that we’ll leap straight into success. We have a unique opportunity to stop and think about what this industry will look like, how it will work, and how we can bring together various disciplines.” This was a theme that arose multiple times over the course of the symposium: the idea that many different stakeholders — including those from academia, industry, and government — will need to work together to explore the viability of geologic hydrogen and bring it to market at scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the potential for hydrogen production to give rise to greenhouse gas emissions (in cases, for instance, where hydrogen deposits are contaminated with natural gas), researchers and industry must also consider landscape deformation and even potential seismic implications, said Bradford Hager, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Earth Sciences in the MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surface impacts of hydrogen exploration and production will likely be similar to those caused by the hydro-fracturing process (“fracking”) used in oil and natural gas extraction, Hager said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There will be unavoidable surface deformation. In most places, you don’t want this if there’s infrastructure around,” Hager said. “Seismicity in the stimulated zone itself should not be a problem, because the areas are tested first. But we need to avoid stressing surrounding brittle rocks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McIntyre noted that the commercial case for hydrogen remains a challenge to quantify, without even a “spot” price that companies can use to make economic calculations. Early on, he said, capturing helium at hydrogen exploration sites could be a path to early cash flow, but that may ultimately serve as a “distraction” as teams attempt to scale up to the primary goal of hydrogen production. He also noted that it is not even yet clear whether hard rock, soft rock, or underwater environments hold the most potential for geologic hydrogen, but all show promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you stack all of these things together,” McIntyre said, “what we end up doing may look very different from what we think we’re going to do right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The path ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the long-term prospects for geologic hydrogen are shrouded in uncertainty, most speakers at the symposium struck a tone of optimism. Ellis noted that the DOE has dedicated $20 million in funding to a stimulated hydrogen program. Paris Smalls, the co-founder and CEO of Eden GeoPower Inc., said “we think there is a path” to producing geologic hydrogen below the $1 per kilogram threshold. And Iwnetim Abate, an assistant professor in the MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering, said that geologic hydrogen opens up the idea of Earth as a “factory to produce clean fuels,” utilizing the subsurface heat and pressure instead of relying on burning fossil fuels or natural gas for the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Earth has had 4.6 billion years to do these experiments,” said Oliver Jagoutz, a professor of geology in the MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. “So there is probably a very good solution out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexis Templeton, a professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado at Boulder, made the case for moving quickly. “Let’s go to pilot, faster than you might think,” she said. “Why? Because we do have some systems that we understand. We could test the engineering approaches and make sure that we are doing the right tool development, the right technology development, the right experiments in the lab. To do that, we desperately need data from the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is growing so fast,” Templeton added. “The momentum and the development of geologic hydrogen is really quite substantial. We need to start getting data at scale. And then, I think, more people will jump off the sidelines very quickly.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Researchers develop a detector for continuously monitoring toxic gases</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most systems used to detect toxic gases in industrial or domestic settings can be used only once, or at best a few times. Now, researchers at MIT have developed a detector that could provide continuous monitoring for the presence of these gases, at low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system combines two existing technologies, bringing them together in a way that preserves the advantages of each while avoiding their limitations. The team used a material called a metal-organic framework, or MOF, which is highly sensitive to tiny traces of gas but whose performance quickly degrades, and combined it with a polymer material that is highly durable and easier to process, but much less sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202312382" target="_blank"&gt;results are reported today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Materials&lt;/em&gt;, in a paper by MIT professors Aristide Gumyusenge, Mircea Dinca, Heather Kulik, and Jesus del Alamo, graduate student Heejung Roh, and postdocs Dong-Ha Kim, Yeongsu Cho, and Young-Moo Jo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly porous and with large surface areas, MOFs come in a variety of compositions. Some can be insulators, but the ones used for this work are highly electrically conductive. With their sponge-like form, they are effective at capturing molecules of various gases, and the sizes of their pores can be tailored to make them selective for particular kinds of gases. “If you are using them as a sensor, you can recognize if the gas is there if it has an effect on the resistivity of the MOF,” says Gumyusenge, the paper’s senior author and the Merton C. Flemings Career Development Assistant Professor of Materials Science and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drawback for these materials’ use as detectors for gases is that they readily become saturated, and then can no longer detect and quantify new inputs. “That’s not what you want. You want to be able to detect and reuse,” Gumyusenge says. “So, we decided to use a polymer composite to achieve this reversibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a class of conductive polymers that Gumyusenge and his co-workers had &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssensors.3c01530" target="_blank"&gt;previously shown&lt;/a&gt; can respond to gases without permanently binding to them. “The polymer, even though it doesn’t have the high surface area that the MOFs do, will at least provide this recognize-and-release type of phenomenon,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team combined the polymers in a liquid solution along with the MOF material in powdered form, and deposited the mixture on a substrate, where they dry into a uniform, thin coating. By combining the polymer, with its quick detection capability, and the more sensitive MOFs, in a one-to-one ratio, he says, “suddenly we get a sensor that has both the high sensitivity we get from the MOF and the reversibility that is enabled by the presence of the polymer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material changes its electrical resistance when molecules of the gas are temporarily trapped in the material. These changes in resistance can be continuously monitored by simply attaching an ohmmeter to track the resistance over time. Gumyusenge and his students demonstrated the composite material’s ability to detect nitrogen dioxide, a toxic gas produced by many kinds of combustion, in a small lab-scale device. After 100 cycles of detection, the material was still maintaining its baseline performance within a margin of about 5 to 10 percent, demonstrating its long-term use potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, this material has far greater sensitivity than most presently used detectors for nitrogen dioxide, the team reports. This gas is often detected after the use of &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adm8680" target="_blank"&gt;stove ovens&lt;/a&gt;. And, with this gas recently linked to many asthma cases in the U.S., reliable detection in low concentrations is important. The team demonstrated that this new composite could detect, reversibly, the gas at concentrations as low as 2 parts per million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While their demonstration was specifically aimed at nitrogen dioxide, Gumyusenge says, “we can definitely tailor the chemistry to target other volatile molecules,” as long as they are small polar analytes, “which tend to be most of the toxic gases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides being compatible with a simple hand-held detector or a smoke-alarm type of device, one advantage of the material is that the polymer allows it to be deposited as an extremely thin uniform film, unlike regular MOFs, which are generally in an inefficient powder form. Because the films are so thin, there is little material needed and production material costs could be low; the processing methods could be typical of those used for industrial coating processes. “So, maybe the limiting factor will be scaling up the synthesis of the polymers, which we’ve been synthesizing in small amounts,” Gumyusenge says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next steps will be to evaluate these in real-life settings,” he says. For example, the material could be applied as a coating on chimneys or exhaust pipes to continuously monitor gases through readings from an attached resistance monitoring device. In such settings, he says, “we need tests to check if we truly differentiate it from other potential contaminants that we might have overlooked in the lab setting. Let’s put the sensors out in real-world scenarios and see how they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported by the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium (MCSC), the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) at MIT, and the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Every year, beer breweries generate and discard thousands of tons of surplus yeast. Researchers from MIT and Georgia Tech have now come up with a way to repurpose that yeast to absorb lead from contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a process called biosorption, yeast can quickly absorb even trace amounts of lead and other heavy metals from water. The researchers showed that they could package the yeast inside hydrogel capsules to create a filter that removes lead from water. Because the yeast cells are encapsulated, they can be easily removed from the water once it’s ready to drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have the hydrogel surrounding the free yeast that exists in the center, and this is porous enough to let water come in, interact with yeast as if they were freely moving in water, and then come out clean,” says Patricia Stathatou, a former postdoc at the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms, who is now a research scientist at Georgia Tech and an incoming assistant professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. “The fact that the yeast themselves are bio-based, benign, and biodegradable is a significant advantage over traditional technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers envision that this process could be used to filter drinking water coming out of a faucet in homes, or scaled up to treat large quantities of water at treatment plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT graduate student Devashish Gokhale and Stathatou&amp;nbsp;are the lead authors of the study, which &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/su/d4su00052h" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;RSC Sustainability&lt;/em&gt;. Patrick Doyle, the Robert T. Haslam Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT, is the senior author of the paper, and Christos Athanasiou, an assistant professor of aerospace engineering at Georgia Tech and a former visiting scholar at MIT, is also an author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorbing lead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study builds on work that Stathatou and Athanasiou began in 2021, when Athanasiou was a visiting scholar at MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms. That year, they calculated that waste yeast discarded from a single brewery in Boston would be enough to treat the city’s entire water supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through biosorption, a process that is not fully understood, yeast cells can bind to and absorb heavy metal ions, even at challenging initial concentrations below 1 part per million. The MIT team found that this process could effectively decontaminate water with low concentrations of lead. However, one key obstacle remained, which was how to remove yeast from the water after they absorb the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a serendipitous coincidence, Stathatou and Athanasiou happened to present their research at the AIChE Annual Meeting in Boston in 2021, where Gokhale, a student in Doyle’s lab, was presenting his own research on using hydrogels to capture micropollutants in water. The two sets of researchers decided to join forces and explore whether the yeast-based strategy could be easier to scale up if the yeast were encapsulated in hydrogels developed by Gokhale and Doyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we decided to do was make these hollow capsules — something like a multivitamin pill, but instead of filling them up with vitamins, we fill them up with yeast cells,” Gokhale says. “These capsules are porous, so the water can go into the capsules and the yeast are able to bind all of that lead, but the yeast themselves can’t escape into the water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capsules are made from a polymer called polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is widely used in medical applications. To form the capsules, the researchers suspend freeze-dried yeast in water, then mix them with the polymer subunits. When UV light is shone on the mixture, the polymers link together to form capsules with yeast trapped inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each capsule is about half a millimeter in diameter. Because the hydrogels are very thin and porous, water can easily pass through and encounter the yeast inside, while the yeast remain trapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers showed that the encapsulated yeast could remove trace lead from water just as rapidly as the unencapsulated yeast from Stathatou and Athanasiou’s original 2021 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Athanasiou, the researchers tested the mechanical stability of the hydrogel capsules and found that the capsules and the yeast inside can withstand forces similar to those generated by water running from a faucet. They also calculated that the yeast-laden capsules should be able to withstand forces generated by flows in water treatment plants serving several hundred residences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lack of mechanical robustness is a common cause of failure of previous attempts to scale-up biosorption using immobilized cells; in our work we wanted to make sure that this aspect is thoroughly addressed from the very beginning to ensure scalability,” Athanasiou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After assessing the mechanical robustness of the yeast-laden capsules, the researchers constructed a proof-of-concept packed-bed biofilter, capable of treating trace lead-contaminated water and meeting U.S. Environmental Protection Agency drinking water guidelines while operating continuously for 12 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process would likely consume less energy than existing physicochemical processes for removing trace inorganic compounds from water, such as precipitation and membrane filtration, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, rooted in circular economy principles, could minimize waste and environmental impact while also fostering economic opportunities within local communities. Although numerous lead contamination incidents have been reported in various locations in the United States, this approach could have an especially significant impact in low-income areas that have historically faced environmental pollution and limited access to clean water, and may not be able to afford other ways to remediate it, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that there’s an interesting environmental justice aspect to this, especially when you start with something as low-cost and sustainable as yeast, which is essentially available anywhere,” Gokhale says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now exploring strategies for recycling and replacing the yeast once they’re used up, and trying to calculate how often that will need to occur. They also hope to investigate whether they could use feedstocks derived from biomass to make the hydrogels, instead of fossil-fuel-based polymers, and whether the yeast can be used to capture other types of contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moving forward, this is a technology that can be evolved to target other trace contaminants of emerging concern, such as PFAS or even microplastics,” Stathatou says. “We really view this as an example with a lot of potential applications in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Rasikbhai L. Meswani Fellowship for Water Solutions, the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS), and the Renewable Bioproducts Institute at Georgia Tech.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT’s &lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab&lt;/a&gt; (J-PAL) and Department of Economics have announced an expansion of their jointly administered &lt;a href="https://economics.mit.edu/academic-programs/masters-programs/masters-data-economics-and-design-policy-dedp"&gt;Master of Applied Science in Data, Economics, and Design of Policy (DEDP) program&lt;/a&gt;. This expansion adds a new public policy track to complement the existing international development track, opening up new avenues for student learning and research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed to tackle poverty alleviation and other pressing policy challenges in the United States and other high-income countries, the curriculum of the new track spans a diverse set of issues, from domestic concerns like minimum wage and consumer welfare to global matters including trade, climate change, and immigration. Applications for the public policy track will open this fall, with the inaugural cohort set to arrive on MIT’s campus in spring 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DEDP program, led by MIT professors and Nobel laureates Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, along with professors Sara Fisher Ellison and Benjamin Olken, was established with the mission of equipping diverse cohorts of talented professionals with the knowledge and skills to tackle poverty using evidence-based approaches. The new master’s degree track will support this mission while also underscoring the program’s commitment to addressing a broad array of critical challenges in the fight against poverty worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The DEDP program has proven successful on many dimensions, and we are enthusiastic about leveraging its successes to address a broader set of social challenges,” says Ellison, a faculty lead for the program. “The public policy track will enable us to apply evidence-based methodology to poverty alleviation and other related issues in the context of high-income countries, as well. Given increasing levels of wealth and income inequality in these countries, we feel that the timing is opportune and the need is great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DEDP program distinguishes itself with an innovative admissions model that prioritizes demonstrated ability and motivation over traditional credentials, such as standardized tests and recommendation letters. To be eligible to apply to the master’s program, candidates must have earned a &lt;a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/" target="_blank"&gt;DEDP MicroMasters&lt;/a&gt; credential by passing five of the DEDP online courses. The courses are completely free to audit. Those who wish to earn a course certificate can pay a fee, which varies by the learner’s ability to pay, to take the proctored exam. While applications are reviewed holistically, performance in these classes is the primary factor in admissions decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach democratizes access to higher education, enabling students from typically underrepresented backgrounds to demonstrate their potential for success. Notably, the program has welcomed many students from nontraditional backgrounds, such as a student who &lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/blog/10-9-19/learner-spotlight-combining-online-courses-classroom-learning" target="_blank"&gt;enrolled directly from high school&lt;/a&gt; (and who is now a second-year PhD student in economics at MIT), reflecting the ambition of its faculty directors to make higher education more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sofia Martinez, a graduate of the class of 2023 and now co-founder of &lt;a href="http://www.learningalliance.net" target="_blank"&gt;Learning Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, says, "Without the MicroMasters paving the way, applying to MIT or any similar institution would have been unthinkable for us. Initially, my aim in taking the online courses wasn't to pursue the residential program; it was only after witnessing my own progress that I realized the possibility wasn't so distant after all. This sentiment resonates with many in our cohort, which is truly humbling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its launch in 2020, the DEDP master’s program has conferred degrees to 87 students from 44 countries, showcasing its global reach and the success of its admissions model. Upon arriving on campus, students embark on an accelerated master's program. They complete a full course load in the spring, followed by a capstone project in the summer, applying the theoretical knowledge and practical skills gained through the program at research and policy organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Jiaqi Zhang | Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) has advanced interdisciplinary research aimed at solving the world's most pressing water and food security challenges to meet human needs. In 2017, J-WAFS established the Rasikbhai L. Meswani Water Solutions Fellowship and the J-WAFS Graduate Student Fellowship. These fellowships provide support to outstanding MIT graduate students who are pursuing research that has the potential to improve water and food systems around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, J-WAFS awarded the 2024-25 fellowships to Jonathan Bessette and Akash Ball, two MIT PhD students dedicated to addressing water scarcity by enhancing desalination and purification processes. This work is of important relevance since the world's freshwater supply has been steadily depleting due to the effects of climate change. In fact, one-third of the global population lacks access to safe drinking water. Bessette and Ball are focused on designing innovative solutions to enhance the resilience and sustainability of global water systems. To support their endeavors, J-WAFS will provide each recipient with funding for one academic semester for continued research and related activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This year, we received many strong fellowship applications,” says J-WAFS executive director Renee J. Robins. “Bessette and Ball both stood out, even in a very competitive pool of candidates. The award of the J-WAFS fellowships to these two students underscores our confidence in their potential to bring transformative solutions to global water challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024-25 Rasikbhai L. Meswani Fellowship for Water Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rasikbhai L. Meswani Fellowship for Water Solutions is a doctoral fellowship for students pursuing research related to water and water supply at MIT. The fellowship is made possible by Elina and Nikhil Meswani and family.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Bessette is a doctoral student in the Global Engineering and Research (GEAR) Center within the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, advised by Professor Amos Winter. His research is focused on water treatment systems for the developing world, mainly desalination, or the process in which salts are removed from water. Currently, Bessette is working on designing and constructing a low-cost, deployable, community-scale desalination system for humanitarian crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In arid and semi-arid regions, groundwater often serves as the sole water source, despite its common salinity issues. Many remote and developing areas lack reliable centralized power and water systems, making brackish groundwater desalination a vital, sustainable solution for global water scarcity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An overlooked need for desalination is inland groundwater aquifers, rather than in coastal areas,” says Bessette. “This is because much of the population lives far enough from a coast that seawater desalination could never reach them. My work involves designing low-cost, sustainable, renewable-powered desalination technologies for highly constrained situations, such as drinking water for remote communities,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this goal, Bessette developed a batteryless, renewable electrodialysis desalination system. The technology is energy-efficient, conserves water, and is particularly suited for challenging environments, as it is decentralized and sustainable. The system offers significant advantages over the conventional reverse osmosis method, especially in terms of reduced energy consumption for treating brackish water. Highlighting Bessette’s capacity for engineering insight, his advisor noted the “simple and elegant solution” that Bessette and a staff engineer, Shane Pratt, devised that negated the need for the system to have large batteries. Bessette is now focusing on simplifying the system’s architecture to make it more reliable and cost-effective for deployment in remote areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in upstate New York, Bessette completed a bachelor's degree at the State University of New York at Buffalo. As an undergrad, he taught middle and high school students in low-income areas of Buffalo about engineering and sustainability. However, he cited his junior-year travel to India and his experience there measuring water contaminants in rural sites as cementing his dedication to a career addressing food, water, and sanitation challenges. In addition to his doctoral research, his commitment to these goals is further evidenced by another project he is pursuing, funded by a J-WAFS India grant, that uses low-cost, remote sensors to better understand water fetching practices. Bessette is conducting this work with fellow MIT student Gokul Sampath in order to help families in rural India gain access to safe drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024-25 J-WAFS Graduate Student Fellowship for Water and Food Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J-WAFS Graduate Student Fellowship is supported by the &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/DirectSponsoredResearch" target="_blank"&gt;J-WAFS Research Affiliate Program&lt;/a&gt;, which offers companies the opportunity to engage with MIT on water and food research. Current fellowship support was provided by two J-WAFS Research Affiliates: &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/xylem" target="_blank"&gt;Xylem&lt;/a&gt;, a leading U.S.-based provider of water treatment and infrastructure solutions, and &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/goaigua" target="_blank"&gt;GoAigua&lt;/a&gt;, a Spanish company at the forefront of digital transformation in the water industry through innovative solutions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akash Ball is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering, advised by Professor Heather Kulik. His research focuses on the computational discovery of novel functional materials for energy-efficient ion separation membranes with high selectivity. Advanced membranes like these are increasingly needed for applications such as water desalination, battery recycling, and removal of heavy metals from industrial wastewater.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Climate change, water pollution, and scarce freshwater reserves cause severe water distress for about 4 billion people annually, with 2 billion in India and China’s semiarid regions,” Ball notes. “One potential solution to this global water predicament is the desalination of seawater, since seawater accounts for 97 percent of all water on Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several commercial reverse osmosis membranes are currently available, these membranes suffer several problems, like slow water permeation, permeability-selectivity trade-off, and high fabrication costs. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials that are promising candidates for highly selective ion separation with fast water transport due to high surface area, the presence of different pore windows, and the tunability of chemical functionality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Kulik lab, Ball is developing a systematic understanding of how MOF chemistry and pore geometry affect water transport and ion rejection rates. By the end of his PhD, Ball plans to identify existing, best-performing MOFs with unparalleled water uptake using machine learning models, propose novel hypothetical MOFs tailored to specific ion separations from water, and discover experimental design rules that enable the synthesis of next-generation membranes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball’s advisor praised the creativity he brings to his research, and his leadership skills that benefit her whole lab. Before coming to MIT, Ball obtained a master’s degree in chemical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay and a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from Jadavpur University in India. During a research internship at IIT Bombay in 2018, he worked on developing a technology for in situ arsenic detection in water. Like Bessette, he noted the impact of this prior research experience on his interest in global water challenges, along with his personal experience growing up in an area in India where access to safe drinking water was not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Jennifer Burke | Office of the Executive Vice President and Treasurer</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT has launched an initiative to install an automated external defibrillator (AED) in every building on MIT’s campus, including leased spaces and satellite locations. The effort will continue over the course of the upcoming year and is supported through funds from MIT’s central budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Rapid access to an AED is a critical step in the survival of cardiac arrest victims,” says Suzanne Blake, director of MIT Emergency Management, which is spearheading the project. “We’re excited about the opportunity to implement this program at MIT and improve our lifesaving capabilities on campus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AEDs work by sending an electric charge to the heart of a person experiencing a cardiac emergency in order to restore their normal heart rhythm. But an AED is only effective if it is in close proximity to the cardiac emergency. While AEDs are not an uncommon sight around MIT&amp;nbsp;— many buildings have them&amp;nbsp;— their availability has been dependent on a department’s purchasing one through its own budget. With this new program, the funding is being provided centrally and the devices are being supplied to units free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was important for the Institute to make this investment to ensure that these devices are widely available to members of our community,” says Glen Shor, executive vice president and treasurer. “Suzanne and her team were critical to making this happen, and they will continue to oversee the program as a whole, including the procurement, administration, and maintenance of AEDs on our campus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only will the program install AEDs in buildings that weren’t previously equipped with them, it will also replace existing ones. For Senior Emergency Management Specialist David Barber, equipping every MIT building with an AED has long been a professional goal&amp;nbsp;— and it’s one that derives from a personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“About 11 years ago. I became infinitely more interested in AEDs because I had a cardiac event on campus, and an AED saved my life,” Barber says. “I'm very lucky.” It’s a story he’s not shy about sharing with others. In fact, he often recounts his experience during CPR classes he teaches to underscore how use of the device, in combination with CPR, can be lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barber also enjoys describing how this particular type of AED made its way to MIT’s campus&amp;nbsp;— or rather, made its return. “Being passionate about AEDs, I'm always on the lookout for the latest, greatest thing,” he says. Several years ago, MIT mechanical engineering students Rory Beyer ’17 and Moseley Andrews ’17 contacted Barber to find out if his office could provide them with used AEDs for a class 2.009 (Product Engineering Process) project. After graduating from MIT, the students continued to build upon the idea, and Barber heard from them again&amp;nbsp;— this time to share information about their company, Avive, which they co-founded with a third partner, Sameer Jafri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy-efficient Avive devices have built-in maintenance tracking. They also provide users with step-by-step instructions on a touch-screen display&amp;nbsp;— a helpful feature for those without experience operating an AED and those who might find the prospect of doing so&amp;nbsp;intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Barber, the success of the new program has been incredibly rewarding. “It's a triple win: One in every building, new technology, and departments don't have to pay for them anymore. That the idea was born in an MIT classroom makes it even better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While training is not required to use an AED, MIT Emergency Management encourages all MIT community members to take &lt;a href="https://prepared.mit.edu/preparedness/individuals/cpr-aed/"&gt;first aid, CPR, and AED training&lt;/a&gt; to become more informed about how to respond to cardiac and other emergencies. MIT is a “&lt;a href="https://www.ncemsf.org/programs/heartsafe-campus"&gt;HeartSafe Campus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt;” a certification granted by the National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation. Contact &lt;a href="mailto:em-staff@mit.edu"&gt;em-staff@mit.edu&lt;/a&gt; with any questions about the AED program.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Advancing technology for aquaculture</title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT Sea Grant students apply machine learning to support local aquaculture hatcheries.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Lily Keyes | MIT Sea Grant</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, aquaculture in the United States represents a $1.5 billion industry annually. Like land-based farming, shellfish aquaculture requires healthy seed production in order to maintain a sustainable industry. Aquaculture hatchery production of shellfish larvae&amp;nbsp;— seeds&amp;nbsp;— requires close monitoring to track mortality rates and assess health from the earliest stages of life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careful observation is necessary to inform production scheduling, determine effects of naturally occurring harmful bacteria, and ensure sustainable seed production. This is an essential step for shellfish hatcheries but is currently a time-consuming manual process prone to human error.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With funding from MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS), MIT Sea Grant is working with Associate Professor Otto Cordero of the MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Professor Taskin Padir and Research Scientist Mark Zolotas at the Northeastern University Institute for Experiential Robotics, and others at the Aquaculture Research Corporation (A.R.C.), and the Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen’s Alliance, to advance technology for the aquaculture industry. Located on Cape Cod, A.R.C. is a leading shellfish hatchery, farm, and wholesaler that plays a vital role in providing high-quality shellfish seed to local and regional growers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two MIT students have joined the effort this semester, working with Robert Vincent, MIT Sea Grant’s assistant director of advisory services, through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First-year student Unyime Usua and sophomore Santiago Borrego are using microscopy images of shellfish seed from A.R.C. to train machine learning algorithms that will help automate the identification and counting process. The resulting user-friendly image recognition tool aims to aid aquaculturists in differentiating and counting healthy, unhealthy, and dead shellfish larvae, improving accuracy and reducing time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vincent explains that AI is a powerful tool for environmental science that enables researchers, industry, and resource managers to address challenges that have long been pinch points for accurate data collection, analysis, predictions, and streamlining processes. “Funding support from programs like J-WAFS enable us to tackle these problems head-on,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ARC faces challenges with manually quantifying larvae classes, an important step in their seed production process. "When larvae are in their growing stages they are constantly being sized and counted,” explains Cheryl James, A.R.C. larval/juvenile production manager. “This process is critical to encourage optimal growth and strengthen the population."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing an automated identification and counting system will help to improve this step in the production process with time and cost benefits. “This is not an easy task,” says Vincent, “but with the guidance of Dr. Zolotas at the Northeastern University Institute for Experiential Robotics and the work of the UROP students, we have made solid progress.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UROP program benefits both researchers and students. Involving MIT UROP students in developing these types of systems provides insights into AI applications that they might not have considered, providing opportunities to explore, learn, and apply themselves while contributing to solving real challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borrego saw this project as an opportunity to apply what he’d learned in class 6.390 (Introduction to Machine Learning) to a real-world issue. “I was starting to form an idea of how computers can see images and extract information from them,” he says. “I wanted to keep exploring that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usua decided to pursue the project because of the direct industry impacts it could have. “I’m pretty interested in seeing how we can utilize machine learning to make people’s lives easier. We are using AI to help biologists make this counting and identification process easier.” While Usua wasn’t familiar with aquaculture before starting this project, she explains, “Just hearing about the hatcheries that Dr. Vincent was telling us about, it was unfortunate that not a lot of people know what’s going on and the problems that they’re facing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Cape Cod alone, aquaculture is an $18 million per year industry. But the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries estimates that hatcheries are only able to meet 70–80 percent of seed demand annually, which impacts local growers and economies. Through this project, the partners aim to develop technology that will increase seed production, advance industry capabilities, and help understand and improve the hatchery microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borrego explains the initial challenge of having limited data to work with. “Starting out, we had to go through and label all of the data, but going through that process helped me learn a lot.” In true MIT fashion, he shares his takeaway from the project: “Try to get the best out of what you’re given with the data you have to work with. You’re going to have to adapt and change your strategies depending on what you have.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usua describes her experience going through the research process, communicating in a team, and deciding what approaches to take. “Research is a difficult and long process, but there is a lot to gain from it because it teaches you to look for things on your own and find your own solutions to problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to increasing seed production and reducing the human labor required in the hatchery process, the collaborators expect this project to contribute to cost savings and technology integration to support one of the most underserved industries in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borrego and Usua both plan to continue their work for a second semester with MIT Sea Grant. Borrego is interested in learning more about how technology can be used to protect the environment and wildlife. Usua says she hopes to explore more projects related to aquaculture. “It seems like there’s an infinite amount of ways to tackle these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Leda Zimmerman | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The King Climate Action Initiative (&lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative/king-climate-action-initiative"&gt;K-CAI&lt;/a&gt;) is the flagship climate change program of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), which innovates, tests, and scales solutions at the nexus of climate change and poverty alleviation, together with policy partners worldwide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claire Walsh is the associate director of policy at J-PAL Global at MIT. She is also the project director of K-CAI. Here, Walsh talks about the work of K-CAI since its launch in 2020, and describes the ways its projects are making a difference. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of an ongoing series exploring how the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences is addressing the climate crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;According to the King Climate Action Initiative (K-CAI), any attempt to address poverty effectively must also simultaneously address climate change. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Climate change will disproportionately harm people in poverty, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, because they tend to live in places that are more exposed to climate risk. These are nations in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia where low-income communities rely heavily on agriculture for their livelihoods, so extreme weather — heat, droughts, and flooding — can be devastating for people’s jobs and food security. In fact, the World Bank estimates that up to 130 million more people may be pushed into poverty by climate change by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is unjust because these countries have historically emitted the least; their people didn’t cause the climate crisis. At the same time, they are trying to improve their economies and improve people’s welfare, so their energy demands are increasing, and they are emitting more. But they don’t have the same resources as wealthy nations for mitigation or adaptation, and many developing countries understandably don’t feel eager to put solving a problem they didn’t create at the top of their priority list. This makes finding paths forward to cutting emissions on a global scale politically challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the problems of enhancing the well-being of people experiencing poverty, addressing inequality, and reducing pollution and greenhouse gases are inextricably linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;So how does K-CAI tackle this hybrid challenge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Our initiative is pretty unique. We are a competitive, policy-based research and development fund that focuses on innovating, testing, and scaling solutions. We support researchers from MIT and other universities, and their collaborators, who are actually implementing programs, whether NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], government, or the private sector. We fund pilots of small-scale ideas in a real-world setting to determine if they hold promise, followed by larger randomized, controlled trials of promising solutions in climate change mitigation, adaptation, pollution reduction, and energy access. Our goal is to determine, through rigorous research, if these solutions are actually working — for example, in cutting emissions or protecting forests or helping vulnerable communities adapt to climate change. And finally, we offer path-to-scale grants which enable governments and NGOs to expand access to programs that have been tested and have strong evidence of impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think this model is really powerful. Since we launched in 2020, we have built a portfolio of over 30 randomized evaluations and 13 scaling projects in more than 35 countries. And to date, these projects have informed the scale ups of evidence-based climate policies that have reached over 15 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;It seems like K-CAI is advancing a kind of policy science, demanding proof of a program’s capacity to deliver results at each stage.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;This is one of the factors that drew me to J-PAL back in 2012. I majored in anthropology and studied abroad in Uganda. From those experiences I became very passionate about pursuing a career focused on poverty reduction. To me, it is unfair that in a world full of so much wealth and so much opportunity there exists so much extreme poverty. I wanted to dedicate my career to that, but I'm also a very detail-oriented nerd who really cares about whether a program that claims to be doing something for people is accomplishing what it claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been really rewarding to see demand from governments and NGOs for evidence-informed policymaking grow over my 12 years at J-PAL. This policy science approach holds exciting promise to help transform public policy and climate policy in the coming decades.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Can you point to K-CAI-funded projects that meet this high bar and are now making a significant impact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Several examples jump to mind. In the state of Gujarat, India, pollution regulators are trying to cut particulate matter air pollution, which is devastating to human health. The region is home to many major industries whose emissions negatively affect most of the state’s 70 million residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We partnered with state pollution regulators — kind of a regional EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] — to test an emissions trading scheme that is used widely in the U.S. and Europe but not in low- and middle-income countries. The government monitors pollution levels using technology installed at factories that sends data in real time, so the regulator knows exactly what their emissions look like. The regulator sets a cap on the overall level of pollution, allocates permits to pollute, and industries can trade emissions permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, researchers in the J-PAL network conducted the world’s first randomized, controlled trial of this emissions trading scheme and found that it cut pollution by 20 to 30 percent — a surprising reduction. It also reduced firms’ costs, on average, because the costs of compliance went down. The state government was eager to scale up the pilot, and in the past two years, two other cities, including Ahmedabad, the biggest city in the state, have adopted the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also supporting a project in Niger, whose economy is hugely dependent on rain-fed agriculture but with climate change is experiencing rapid desertification. Researchers in the J-PAL network have been testing training farmers in a simple, inexpensive rainwater harvesting technique, where farmers dig a half-moon-shaped hole called a demi-lune right before the rainy season. This demi-lune feeds crops that are grown directly on top of it, and helps return land that resembled flat desert to arable production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that training farmers in this simple technology increased adoption from 4 percent to 94 percent and that demi-lunes increased agricultural output and revenue for farmers from the first year. K-CAI is funding a path-to-scale grant so local implementers can teach this technique to over 8,000 farmers and build a more cost-effective program model. If this takes hold, the team will work with local partners to scale the training to other relevant regions of the country and potentially other countries in the Sahel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final example that we are really proud of, because we first funded it as a pilot and now it’s in the path to scale phase: We supported a team of researchers working with partners in Bangladesh trying to reduce carbon emissions and other pollution from brick manufacturing, an industry that generates 17 percent of the country’s carbon emissions. The scale of manufacturing is so great that at some times of year, Dhaka (the capital of Bangladesh) looks like Mordor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workers form these bricks and stack hundreds of thousands of them, which they then fire by burning coal. A team of local researchers and collaborators from our J-PAL network found that you can reduce the amount of coal needed for the kilns by making some low-cost changes to the manufacturing process, including stacking the bricks in a way that increases airflow in the kiln and feeding the coal fires more frequently in smaller rather than larger batches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the randomized, controlled trial K-CAI supported, researchers found that this cut carbon and pollution emissions significantly, and now the government has invited the team to train 1,000 brick manufacturers in Dhaka in these techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;These are all fascinating and powerful instances of implementing ideas that address a range of problems in different parts of the world. But can K-CAI go big enough and fast enough to take a real bite out of the twin poverty and climate crisis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;We're not trying to find silver bullets. We are trying to build a large playbook of real solutions that work to solve specific problems in specific contexts. As you build those up in the hundreds, you have a deep bench of effective approaches to solve problems that can add up in a meaningful way. And because J-PAL works with governments and NGOs that have the capacity to take the research into action, since 2003, over 600 million people around the world have been reached by policies and programs that are informed by evidence that J-PAL-affiliated researchers produced. While global challenges seem daunting, J-PAL has shown that in 20 years we can achieve a great deal, and there is huge potential for future impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, globally, there is an underinvestment in policy innovation to combat climate change that may generate quicker, lower-cost returns at a large scale — especially in policies that determine which technologies get adopted or commercialized. For example, a lot of the huge fall in prices of renewable energy was enabled by early European government investments in solar and wind, and then continuing support for innovation in renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I think social sciences have so much to offer in the fight against climate change and poverty; we are working where technology meets policy and where technology meets real people, which often determines their success or failure. The world should be investing in policy, economic, and social innovation just as much as it is investing in technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you need to be an optimist in your job?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;I am half-optimist, half-pragmatist. I have no control over the climate change outcome for the world. And regardless of whether we can successfully avoid most of the potential damages of climate change, when I look back, I'm going to ask myself, “Did I fight or not?” The only choice I have is whether or not I fought, and I want to be a fighter.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the Boston suburbs, MIT senior Daisy Wang spent her spare time upside down underwater, dancing with her competitive artistic swimming team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It feels like you and your teammates are one unit in the water, moving and working together, and there is an incredible amount of trust involved with all of the lifts and throws,” she said from her dorm room on campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From synchronized swimming, Wang learned a valuable lesson about how people are deeply interconnected: One person’s challenge is everyone’s challenge. Many evenings, when Wang isn’t at MIT, she can be found pacing the deck of the very same pool at Cambridge Synchro, where she’s moved into a coaching role on the team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wang is an aspiring physician, majoring in &lt;a href="https://be.mit.edu/"&gt;biological engineering&lt;/a&gt; and minoring in &lt;a href="http://wgs.mit.edu"&gt;women’s and gender studies&lt;/a&gt;. She says what pulls her into both disciplines is a passion for engineering solutions for social problems that have the potential to effect systemic change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am a completely different person in my biological engineering classes and my women’s and gender studies courses,” Wang says. Biological engineering demands creative problem-solving and boundless iteration, while women’s and gender studies requires a different, equally critical skill set, she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From my first WGS.101 class, we have never just read a static text. We apply the texts to our lives and share our personal experiences, looking at the real world through a gender framework,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding ways to benefit society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fall 2023, Wang’s two academic worlds unexpectedly collided in class 20.380 (Biological Engineering Design), a capstone course in which small groups of undergraduates integrate theoretical knowledge to design hypothetical new products to benefit society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She explains, “My team wanted to come up with a system that could automatically sense opioid overdose in drug users and administer an emergency treatment of Narcan (naloxone HCI).”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Drug Abuse reported that in 2021, there were 80,411 opioid overdose deaths in the United States. Although Narcan, a drug that rapidly reverses overdose, is increasingly available at major drug stores like CVS, Wang and her colleagues noted that Narcan cannot be self-administered.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many overdoses take place when users are alone. Wang says, “Narcan works by binding to the opioid receptors and acts as an antagonist. Our idea was to develop a microneedle patch to detect and treat overdose.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Wang learned more about the opioid epidemic, she realized that, “Ultimately, new technologies mean nothing if we can’t make them work for the people that need them.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her work as an intern in the Health Equity Research Lab at Cambridge Health Alliance, she sees this firsthand in a local hospital system. With funding from the &lt;a href="https://pkgcenter.mit.edu"&gt;Priscilla King Gray Public Service Center&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at MIT, Wang is helping a team analyze data regarding the implementation of a mental health survey tool used by clinicians to monitor patients’ symptoms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says, “Right now, this is a digital survey tool — and that’s actually a big equity issue. For example, many patients don’t speak English, and some don’t have access to a phone with internet access, which is how the survey is administered.” Wang is digging deeply into both qualitative and quantitative data to make recommendations for improving this tool for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internship helped her determine that she wants to specialize in implementation science as a physician, studying how evidence-based solutions are translated into practice and made accessible to patient populations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Passion breeds passion”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on campus, Wang is the operations chair of &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/mitpleasure/?hl=en"&gt;PLEASURE@MIT&lt;/a&gt;, a student-led group that sets out to increase positive relationships on campus through education and shifting cultural norms. She often facilitates peer-to-peer workshops and training on sensitive topics like safe sex, consent, self-love, and positive body image.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experience of facilitating difficult conversations, listening deeply, and helping to support a community translated into fieldwork in Oyugis, Kenya, this January as a student enrolled in EC.718/WGS. 277 (MIT D-Lab Gender and Development course). The class was co-taught by Sally Haslanger, the Ford Professor of Philosophy and Women's and Gender Studies, and D-Lab lecturer Libby McDonald.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the field, Wang and peers supported an ongoing D-Lab initiative in collaboration with an in-country community-based organization, the Society Empowerment Project. Together, they aimed to co-design solutions for educating youth on menstrual and reproductive health and ways to support teen parents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her biggest takeaway was observing, “Passion breeds passion.” That was especially true among team members who gave up sleep each night of the trip to prepare slides for the following day’s workshop and motivated one another to care deeply about the community. She says, “This was also applicable to the participants who commuted from far away to partake in the workshop and reflect deeply on solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience in Kenya brought together Wang’s studies, research, internship, and even her biggest future goal of becoming a physician advocating for patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She dove in with excitement, but just like in synchronized swimming, Wang says, “We did everything in true partnership with the team on the ground. While we provided support about the design cycle and logistics of ideation, imaging, prototyping, and testing, our partners were the ones thinking up their own program.” One move at a time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrosocial displacement refers to the idea that resolving water conflict in one area can shift the conflict to a different area. The concept was coined by Scott Odell, a visiting researcher in MIT’s Environmental Solutions Initiative (ESI). As part of ESI’s Program on Mining and the Circular Economy, Odell researches the impacts of extractive industries on local environments and communities, especially in Latin America. He discovered that hydrosocial displacements are often in regions where the mining industry is vying for use of precious water sources that are already stressed due to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odell is working with John Fernández, ESI director and professor in the Department of Architecture, on a project that is examining the converging impacts of climate change, mining, and agriculture in Chile. The work is funded by a seed grant from MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS). Specifically, the project seeks to answer how the expansion of seawater desalination by the mining industry is affecting local populations, and how climate change and mining affect Andean glaciers and the agricultural communities dependent upon them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By working with communities in mining areas, Odell and Fernández are gaining a sense of the burden that mining minerals needed for the clean energy transition is placing on local populations, and the types of conflicts that arise when water sources become polluted or scarce. This work is of particular importance considering over &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/reflecting-cop28-progress-toward-meeting-global-climate-goals-0206"&gt;100 countries&lt;/a&gt; pledged a commitment to the clean energy transition at the recent United Nations climate change conference, known as COP28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water, humanity’s lifeblood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the March 2023 United Nations (U.N.) Water Conference in New York, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres &lt;a href="https://press.un.org/en/2023/sgsm21737.doc.htm"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; “water is in deep trouble. We are draining humanity’s lifeblood through vampiric overconsumption and unsustainable use and evaporating it through global heating.” A quarter of the world’s population already faces “extremely high water stress,” according to the World Resources Institute. In an effort to raise awareness of major water-related issues and inspire action for innovative solutions, the U.N. created World Water Day, observed every year on March 22. This year’s theme is “Water for Peace,” underscoring the fact that even though water is a basic human right and intrinsic to every aspect of life, it is increasingly fought over as supplies dwindle due to problems including drought, overuse, and mismanagement. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Water for Peace” theme is exemplified in Fernández and Odell’s J-WAFS project, where findings are intended to inform policies to reduce social and environmental harms inflicted on mining communities and their limited water sources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Despite broad academic engagement with mining and climate change separately, there has been a lack of analysis of the societal implications of the interactions between mining and climate change,” says Odell. “This project is helping to fill the knowledge gap. Results will be summarized in Spanish and English and distributed to interested and relevant parties in Chile, ensuring that the results can be of benefit to those most impacted by these challenges,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effects of mining for the clean energy transition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global climate change is understood to be the most pressing environmental issue facing humanity today. Mitigating climate change requires reducing carbon emissions by transitioning away from conventional energy derived from burning fossil fuels, to more sustainable energy sources like solar and wind power. Because copper is an excellent conductor of electricity, it will be a crucial element in the clean energy transition, in which more solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles will be manufactured. “We are going to see a major increase in demand for copper due to the clean energy transition,” says Odell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Chile produced 26 percent of the world's copper, more than twice as much as any other country, Odell explains. Much of Chile’s mining is concentrated in and around the Atacama Desert — the world’s driest desert. Unfortunately, mining requires large amounts of water for a variety of processes, including controlling dust at the extraction site, cooling machinery, and processing and transporting ore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chile is also one of the world’s largest exporters of agricultural products. Farmland is typically situated in the valleys downstream of several mines in the high Andes region, meaning mines get first access to water. This can lead to water conflict between mining operations and agricultural communities. Compounding the problem of mining for greener energy materials to combat climate change, are the very effects of climate change. According to the Chilean government, the country has suffered 13 years of the worst drought in history. While this is detrimental to the mining industry, it is also concerning for those working in agriculture, including the Indigenous Atacameño communities that live closest to the Escondida mine, the largest copper mine in the world. “There was never a lot of water to go around, even before the mine,” Odell says. The addition of Escondida stresses an already strained water system, leaving Atacameño farmers and individuals vulnerable to severe water insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, waste from mining, known as tailings, includes minerals and chemicals that can contaminate water in nearby communities if not properly handled and stored. Odell says the secure storage of tailings is a high priority in earthquake-prone Chile. “If an earthquake were to hit and damage a tailings dam, it could mean toxic materials flowing downstream and destroying farms and communities,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chile’s treasured glaciers are another piece of the mining, climate change, and agricultural puzzle. Caroline White-Nockleby, a PhD candidate in MIT’s Program in Science, Technology, and Society, is working with Odell and Fernández on the J-WAFS project and leading the research specifically on glaciers. “These may not be the picturesque bright blue glaciers that you might think of, but they are, nonetheless, an important source of water downstream,” says White-Nockleby. She goes on to explain that there are a few different ways that mines can impact glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, mining companies have proposed to move or even destroy glaciers to get at the ore beneath. Other impacts include dust from mining that falls on glaciers. White-Nockleby says, “this makes the glaciers a darker color, so, instead of reflecting the sun's rays away, [the glacier] may absorb the heat and melt faster.” This shows that even when not directly intervening with glaciers, mining activities can cause glacial decline, adding to the threat glaciers already face due to climate change. She also notes that “glaciers are an important water storage facility,” describing how, on an annual cycle, glaciers freeze and melt, allowing runoff that downstream agricultural communities can utilize. If glaciers suddenly melt too quickly, flooding of downstream communities can occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desalination offers a possible, but imperfect, solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chile’s extensive coastline makes it uniquely positioned to utilize &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/podcasts/e4-can-desalination-solve-water-scarcity"&gt;desalination&lt;/a&gt; — the removal of salts from seawater — to address water insecurity. Odell says that “over the last decade or so, there's been billions of dollars of investments in desalination in Chile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of his dissertation work at Clark University, Odell found broad optimism in Chile for solving water issues in the mining industry through desalination. Not only was the mining industry committed to building desalination plants, there was also political support, and support from some community members in highland communities near the mines. Yet, despite the optimism and investment, desalinated water was not replacing the use of continental water. He concluded that “desalination can’t solve water conflict if it doesn't reduce demand for continental water supplies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after publishing those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652621032935?via%3Dihub"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;, Odell learned that new estimates at the national level showed that desalination operations had begun to replace the use of continental water after 2018. In two case studies that he currently focuses on — the Escondida and Los Pelambres copper mines — the mining companies have expanded their desalination objectives in order to reduce extraction from key continental sources. This seems to be due to a variety of factors. For one thing, in 2022, Chile’s water code was reformed to prioritize human water consumption and environmental protection of water during scarcity and in the allocation of future rights. It also shortened the granting of water rights from “in perpetuity” to 30 years. Under this new code, it is possible that the mining industry may have expanded its desalination efforts because it viewed continental water resources as less secure, Odell surmises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the J-WAFS project, Odell has found that recent reactions have been mixed when it comes to the rapid increase in the use of desalination. He spent over two months doing fieldwork in Chile by conducting interviews with members of government, industry, and civil society at the Escondida, Los Pelambres, and Andina mining sites, as well as in Chile’s capital city, Santiago. He has spoken to local and national government officials, leaders of fishing unions, representatives of mining and desalination companies, and farmers. He observed that in the communities where the new desalination plants are being built, there have been concerns from community members as to whether they will get access to the desalinated water, or if it will belong solely to the mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviews at the Escondida and Los Pelambres sites, in which desalination operations are already in place or under construction, indicate acceptance of the presence of desalination plants combined with apprehension about unknown long-term environmental impacts. At a third mining site, Andina, there have been active protests against a desalination project that would supply water to a neighboring mine, Los Bronces. In that community, there has been a blockade of the desalination operation by the fishing federation. “They were blockading that operation for three months because of concerns over what the desalination plant would do to their fishing grounds,” Odell says. And this is where the idea of hydrosocial displacement comes into the picture, he explains. Even though desalination operations are easing tensions with highland agricultural communities, new issues are arising for the communities on the coast. “We can't just look to desalination to solve our problems if it's going to create problems somewhere else” Odell advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the process of hydrosocial displacement, interacting geographical, technical, economic, and political factors constrain the range of responses to address the water conflict. For example, communities that have more political and financial power tend to be better equipped to solve water conflict than less powerful communities. In addition, hydrosocial concerns usually follow the flow of water downstream, from the highlands to coastal regions. Odell says that this raises the need to look at water from a broader perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We tend to address water concerns one by one and that can, in practice, end up being kind of like whack-a-mole,” says Odell. “When we think of the broader hydrological system, water is very much linked, and we need to look across the watershed. We can't just be looking at the specific community affected now, but who else is affected downstream, and will be affected in the long term. If we do solve a water issue by moving it somewhere else, like moving a tailings dam somewhere else, or building a desalination plant, resources are needed in the receiving community to respond to that,” suggests Odell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company building the desalination plant and the fishing federation ultimately reached an agreement and the desalination operation will be moving forward. But Odell notes, “the protest highlights concern about the impacts of the operation on local livelihoods and environments within the much larger context of industrial pollution in the area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power of communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protest by the fishing federation is one example of communities coming together to have their voices heard. Recent proposals by mining companies that would affect glaciers and other water sources used by agriculture communities have led to other protests that resulted in new agreements to protect local water supplies and the withdrawal of some of the mining proposals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Odell observes that communities have also gone to the courts to raise their concerns. The Atacameño communities, for example, have drawn attention to over-extraction of water resources by the Escondida mine. “Community members are also pursuing education in these topics so that there's not such a power imbalance between mining companies and local communities,” Odell remarks. This demonstrates the power local communities can have to protect continental water resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The political and social landscape of Chile may also be changing in favor of local communities. Beginning with what is now referred to as the Estallido Social (social outburst) over inequality in 2019, Chile has undergone social upheaval that resulted in voters calling for a new constitution. Gabriel Boric, a progressive candidate, whose top priorities include social and environmental issues, was elected president during this period. These trends have brought major attention to issues of economic inequality, environmental harms of mining, and environmental justice, which is putting pressure on the mining industry to make a case for its operations in the country, and to justify the environmental costs of mining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens after the mine dries up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From his fieldwork interviews, Odell has learned that the development of mines within communities can offer benefits. Mining companies typically invest directly in communities through employment, road construction, and sometimes even by building or investing in schools, stadiums, or health clinics. Indirectly, mines can have spillover effects in the economy since miners might support local restaurants, hotels, or stores. But what happens when the mine closes? As one community member Odell interviewed stated: “When the mine is gone, what are we going to have left besides a big hole in the ground?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odell suggests that a multi-pronged approach should be taken to address the future state of water and mining. First, he says we need to have broader conversations about the nature of our consumption and production at domestic and global scales. “Mining is driven indirectly by our consumption of energy and directly by our consumption of everything from our buildings to devices to cars,” Odell states. “We should be looking for ways to moderate our consumption and consume smarter through both policy and practice so that we don’t solve climate change while creating new environmental harms through mining.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the main ways we can do this is by advancing the circular economy by recycling metals already in the system, or even in landfills, to help build our new clean energy infrastructure. Even so, the clean energy transition will still require mining, but according to Odell, that mining can be done better. “Mining companies and government need to do a better job of consulting with communities. We need solid plans and financing for mine closures in place from the beginning of mining operations, so that when the mine dries up, there's the money needed to secure tailings dams and protect the communities who will be there forever,” Odell concludes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, it will take an engaged society — from the mining industry to government officials to individuals — to think critically about the role we each play in our quest for a more sustainable planet, and what that might mean for the most vulnerable populations among us.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Reflecting on COP28 — and humanity’s progress toward meeting global climate goals</title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT delegates share observations and insights from the largest-ever UN climate conference.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 17:10:00 -0500</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/reflecting-cop28-progress-toward-meeting-global-climate-goals-0206</guid>
        <dc:creator>Office of the Vice President for Research</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With 85,000 delegates, the 2023 United Nations climate change conference, known as COP28, was the largest U.N. climate conference in history. It was held at the end of the hottest year in recorded history. And after 12 days of negotiations, from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12, it produced a decision that included, for the first time, language calling for “transitioning away from fossil fuels,” though it stopped short of calling for their complete phase-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/news/cop28-agreement-signals-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-fossil-fuel-era"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the outcome in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, COP28’s host city, signaled “the beginning of the end” of the fossil fuel era.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COP stands for “conference of the parties” to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, held this year for the 28th time. Through the negotiations — and the immense conference and expo that takes place alongside them — a delegation of faculty, students, and staff from MIT was in Dubai to observe the negotiations, present new climate technologies, speak on panels, network, and conduct research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 17, the MIT Center for International Studies (CIS) hosted a panel discussion with MIT delegates who shared their reflections on the experience. Asking what’s going on at COP is “like saying, ‘What’s going on in the city of Boston today?’” quipped Evan Lieberman, the Total Professor of Political Science and Contemporary Africa, director of CIS, and faculty director of MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI). “The value added that all of us can provide for the MIT community is [to share] what we saw firsthand and how we experienced it.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase-out, phase down, transition away?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first week of COP28, over 100 countries issued a &lt;a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/11/30/joint-statement-of-the-organisation-of-african-caribbean-and-pacific-states-and-the-european-union-for-cop-28/"&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt; that included a call for “the global phase out of unabated fossil fuels.” The question of whether the COP28 decision — dubbed the “UAE Consensus” — would include this phase-out language animated much of the discussion in the days and weeks leading up to COP28.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the decision called for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner.” It also called for “accelerating efforts towards the phase down of unabated coal power,” referring to the combustion of coal without efforts to capture and store its emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dubai to observe the negotiations, graduate student Alessandra Fabbri said she was “confronted” by the degree to which semantic differences could impose significant ramifications — for example, when negotiators referred to a “just transition,” or to “developed vs. developing nations” — particularly where evolution in recent scholarship has produced more nuanced understandings of the terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COP28 also marked the conclusion of the first global stocktake, a core component of the 2015 &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement"&gt;Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. The effort every five years to assess the world’s progress in responding to climate change is intended as a basis for encouraging countries to strengthen their climate goals over time, a process often referred to as the Paris Agreement’s “ratchet mechanism.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/sb2023_09E.pdf?download"&gt;technical report&lt;/a&gt; of the first global stocktake, published in September 2023, found that while the world has taken actions that have reduced forecasts of future warming, they are not sufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global average temperature increase to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Despite minor, punctual advancements in climate action, parties are far from being on track to meet the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement,” said Fabbri, a graduate student in the School of Architecture and Planning and a fellow in MIT's Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism. Citing a number of persistent challenges, including some parties’ fears that rapid economic transition may create or exacerbate vulnerabilities, she added, “There is a noted lack of accountability among certain countries in adhering to their commitments and responsibilities under international climate agreements.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate and trade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COP28 was the first climate summit to formally acknowledge the importance of international trade by featuring an official “Trade Day” on Dec. 4. Internationally traded goods account for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, raising complex questions of accountability and concerns about offshoring of industrial manufacturing, a phenomenon known as “emissions leakage.” Addressing the nexus of climate and trade is therefore considered essential for successful decarbonization, and a growing number of countries are leveraging trade policies — such as &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/carbon-border-adjustments"&gt;carbon fees applied to imported goods&lt;/a&gt; — to secure climate benefits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the MIT delegation participated in several related activities, sharing research and informing decision-makers. Catherine Wolfram, professor of applied economics in the MIT Sloan School of Management, and Michael Mehling, deputy director of the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research (CEEPR), presented options for international cooperation on such trade policies at side events, including ones hosted by the World Trade Organization and European Parliament.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While COPs are often criticized for highlighting statements that don’t have any bite, they are also tremendous opportunities to get people from around the world who care about climate and think deeply about these issues in one place,” said Wolfram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate and health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in the conference’s nearly 30-year history, COP28 included a thematic “Health Day” that featured talks on the relationship between climate and health. Researchers from MIT’s &lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"&gt;Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab &lt;/a&gt;(J-PAL) have been testing policy solutions in this area for years through research funds such as the &lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative/king-climate-action-initiative"&gt;King Climate Action Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (K-CAI).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An important but often-neglected area where climate action can lead to improved health is combating air pollution,” said Andre Zollinger, K-CAI’s senior policy manager. “COP28's announcement on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/cop28-headlines-methane"&gt;reducing methane leaks&lt;/a&gt; is an important step because action in this area could translate to relatively quick, cost-effective ways to curb climate change while improving air quality, especially for people living near these industrial sites.” K-CAI has an &lt;a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative-project/reducing-methane-emissions-oil-and-gas-sector-rct-policy-and-technology"&gt;ongoing project&lt;/a&gt; in Colorado investigating the use of machine learning to predict leaks and improve the framework for regulating industrial methane emissions, Zollinger noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was J-PAL’s third time at COP, which Zollinger said typically presented an opportunity for researchers to share new findings and analysis with government partners, nongovernmental organizations, and companies. This year, he said, “We have [also] been working with negotiators in the [Middle East and North Africa] region in the months preceding COP to plug them into the latest evidence on water conservation, on energy access, on different challenging areas of adaptation that could be useful for them during the conference.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing knowledge, learning from others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT student Runako Gentles described COP28 as a “springboard” to greater impact. A senior from Jamaica studying civil and environmental engineering, Gentles said it was exciting to introduce himself as an MIT undergraduate to U.N. employees and Jamaican delegates in Dubai. “There’s a lot of talk on mitigation and cutting carbon emissions, but there needs to be much more going into climate adaptation, especially for small-island developing states like those in the Caribbean,” he said. “One of the things I can do, while I still try to finish my degree, is communicate&amp;nbsp;— get the story out there to raise awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an official side event at COP28 hosted by MIT, Pennsylvania State University, and the American Geophysical Union, Maria T. Zuber, MIT’s vice president for research, stressed the importance of opportunities to share knowledge and learn from people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The reason this two-way learning is so important for us is simple: The ideas we come up with in a university setting, whether they’re technological or policy or any other kind of innovations — they only matter in the practical world if they can be put to good use and scaled up,” said Zuber. “And the only way we can know that our work has practical relevance for addressing climate is by working hand-in-hand with communities, industries, governments, and others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcela Angel, research program director at the Environmental Solutions Initiative, and Sergey Paltsev, deputy director of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, also spoke at the event, which was moderated by Bethany Patten, director of policy and engagement for sustainability at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
